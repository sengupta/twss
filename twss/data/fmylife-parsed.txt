my husbands old fraternity brother came to visit
he fell out of his car puked then passed out drunk in our driveway
we got him to the bathroom where he fell asleep
he woke up at 4am wandered around the house naked pooped in my trash can then passed out again
i found out that my beautiful engagement ring is a remake of the late princess dianas engagement ring
i also found out my fiance bought it from an infomercial for $19
my ex-girlfriend came over to console me after a breakup
after beating me repeatedly in mariokart she decided to leave
the alarm clock downstairs has been going off since 3am
the apartment belongs to two other students
theyve gone home
only 3 more days left to go
i was at my friends house
we were looking at her dads guns and i was explaining gun safety and how you should never put your finger on the trigger
i then shot a hole in the floor of her house
i went for a drive with my boyfriend and his dad
his dad was kind enough to point out at every opportunity girls that would be better for him than me
while sitting next to the cute guy in my english class i had to sneeze
i turned away from him and sneezed into my arm
my long hair got in the way and i accidently shot a huge snot rocket into my hair
i spent the rest of the class trying to get it out without him noticing
i went to the store and ran into an old friend that i hadnt seen in years
we chatted a little and just as i was leaving he grabbed his mobile phone
later i added him on facebook
turns out the last thing he posted was a picture of my back saying: look who got even fatter
it was my first day back to school after break
i wasnt feeling well but i decided to go anyway
i threw up in the hallway and shit myself at the same time
i waited in the office for my dad to come and get me for almost an hour while wearing dirty underwear
i found out that my friend makes more money than i do
shes a high school dropout and working at a retail job at the mall
i went to college for four years to get my job
while changing my clothes my 3 year old daughter informed me that i looked like a zebra
noticing my shocked face she tried comforting me by telling me i was a pretty zebra because i was a purple zebra
she was talking about my stretch marks
my boyfriend told me there was a tick on my shoulder and that he would remove it so i shouldnt worry
after about a half hour lots of blood and a ton of pain he told me it was just a mole
my boss and i were stacking boxes in the back room of the store
one of the boxes fell and hit me in the face causing me to lose my glasses
my boss stepped on my glasses as she ran to check the box for broken merchandise which i then had to pay for
i was woken up by the sound of part of my kitchen ceiling hitting the floor
i had a job interview
the interviewer asked me to give 5 adjectives describing myself
i listed 7
the last one being listener
my girlfriend dumped me for the tattoo artist who gave us our matching love tattoos
i discovered after four hours of vomiting that it is very much possible to vomit so hard you cant help but shit in your trousers
my boyfriend is currently staying over too
between my cats scratching every surface they can find my boyfriends snoring and the dog barking at every slight noise outside im unlikely to ever get more than 3 hours of sleep at a time
i took my daughter to the library instead of the pool
i sat her on the counter and while i reached for my library card she turned to the librarian and said we didnt go to the pool today because mum has hairy legs
my girlfriend whom im crazy about broke up with me out of the blue
after pleading with her unsuccessfully i called my mom for comfort and advice
she informed me that my dog had died
while walking on the sidewalk with my boyfriend i slipped and fell
not only did he not help me get up or ask if i was okay he got mad at me for embarrassing him in public
i was talking to my boyfriend about our new years resolutions
i started telling him that i wanted to lose some weight
he interrupted me saying yeah yeah we all know youre fat whatever
he then went on a 30 minute speech about how hed really like to take more pictures of his cat in 2011
my boyfriend decided to re-enact a scene from family guy
he locked me in the car with him and farted deadly ones repeatedly
he wouldnt let me out until i learned to love the gas
i hit a parked car which was sticking out in the road and practically unavoidable
i left a note on the windshield saying you deserved to get hit - you park like an asshole
later i realized that the paper i tore to write on was the back of my bank statement name and address included
i was out running
all of a sudden i saw a dog come towards me i thought it was going to attack me and i screamed like a girl in front of everyone
it was a puppy wanting to play
it was opening night for the play where i was for the first time ever one of the leads
i went on stage with a loud and energetic entrance
i came in two scenes early
i was talking to a really cute guy
he leaned closer and i thought he was going to kiss me
instead he leaned back laughed and said wow
youre growing a mustache
my boss walked in and said something i didnt quite hear but my co-worker chuckled so to be polite i laughed with him
they gave me some weird looks
my boss was actually talking about his wifes tumor and my co-worker was coughing
i found out my identity was stolen
the person got credit cards in my name and didnt pay the bills which has ruined my near perfect credit
the worst part about all of this is that i cant turn the person in
its my mom and sending her to jail wouldnt really work out for anyone
while i was out of the office id left my phone charging inside
my boss informed me that since i am clearly running up her electricity bill it will be deducted out of my already nearly non existent paycheck
i was driving back from school 100 miles away from my home with my fiancÃ© and dog
while stopping for gas we accidentally left our car keys and cell phones in the car
the dog sat on one of the keys and engaged the locks
we were locked out of the car until the tow truck arrived
i returned to work after celebrating the new year in mexico
i wasnt feeling well but didnt want to call in sick after already taking a vacation
now im at work with diarrhea and trotting to the bathroom every 30 minutes
my commute home usually takes around an hour
at work my computer started acting up
i told my boss i could fix it but he told me to call the it department instead
neither the it technician or his supervisor could figure it out so i showed them what was wrong and how to fix it
i was promptly fired for wasting 2 hours of company time
my mother came over again to help me work on my student aid application
she also brought over the savings bonds that she has been accumulating since i was born to help pay for college
turns out they wont reach maturity until im thirty
she never bothered to check out this fact
im screwed for college
i have been teaching my 5 year-old step-daughter how to read and write
she came bounding up to me with a piece of paper and said look what i did
it was a letter that said my dad misses my real mommy not you
i changed my facebook relationship status to in a relationship
the girl is made up and the picture is from google
my cheating ex-boyfriend was offered the job we both interviewed for
i helped him with his cover letter before i found out about the affair
ive been unemployed for almost two years
i was feeling sick but went into my waitressing job because id already missed 3 days this week
i was dizzy and managed to spill a tray of drinks all over the customers
then when their food was done i tripped and spilled hot chili all over the mans lap
i was at the doctors getting some skin scraped off the bottom of my foot for some tests
as soon as the doctor grabbed my foot it tickled and i accidentally kicked him in the face
during this the blade sliced my foot open
i found the birthday card my grandma had mailed
apparently it contained a gift of $100
too bad it was in my moms trash can opened with no money
she told my grandma it must have gotten lost in the mail
i had a panic attack at 2am because someone decided to throw a snowball at my window
i was at the nursing home i work at and my boss asked me if im serious about my job telling me that ive been acting strange and not working hard enough
she wants to drug test me
the real reason im not 100% is because i have a stomach ulcer from the stress of working there
i had a plaster cast removed from my arm
after telling the nurse it felt like the saw was cutting my skin she tells me there is no way that it could touch my skin and that i was being paranoid
she cracked open the cast
burns blisters and bleeding skin were revealed
i had a show with my drama group
my mom isnt a good drunk she decided to scream along to every song and pass out halfway through
she was in the front row
for the first time ever my boyfriend of one year told me he loved me
he was calling me by collect call from the county jail
i went to the toilet during drama not because i had to actually go but because i wanted to play monopoly on my ipod
i lost track of time and came back twenty minutes later
my whole class listened while i was forced to tell my teacher id been really constipated
in gym class we were forced to learn the hoedown throwdown dance by miley cyrus
this will actually be counted toward my grade
im in high school
a kid grabbed the receiver to my cochlear implant and ran off with it
i went to a security guard and if my lip reading was accurate he said to try and make it through the day without it
without it i cant hear anything
i fell and got a nasty cut above my right eye
the doctor in the er sealed the wound with surgical glue
he also glued his glove to my eyebrow and let glue run onto my eyelid
not only do i have a scar and medical bill i now have no eyebrow or eyelashes on my right eye
feeling melancholy i took a blanket out to the backyard and lay down to look at the clouds
my dad came out to ask me what i was doing
i told him he smirked squatted over my face and farted
he then ran back inside and told my mom
she laughed
after lifting a 20 pound box of oranges for a woman at work she turned around to say your acne needs help
i still had to tell her to have a good day
my 2 year-old son decided to pee on the dog for the second day in a row
im afraid this will turn into a routine thing
i had to walk three miles home from work
both my parents were at home
the reason they wouldnt collect me is apparently because ive gotten so fat your grandma cried after she saw you
i got diarrhea while on a trip with my daughters
at our third stop i had to sit in the stall listening to my 5 year-old informing everyone who came in that mommy is stopping at every bathroom to poop
my boyfriend broke up with me via text message
you would think he could at least spell my name right while ending our relationship
at work i was asked to sharpen some pencils
im an electronics and mechanics engineer and while i understand its been quite a while since i was in primary school i still wonder why my boss felt the need to explain in minute detail how to sharpen a pencil
i was on the plane asleep
i woke up after feeling the plane jolt and i screamed at the top of my lungs
the little girl next to me told me i was a sissy
everyone on the plane laughed
i finally found out why my fish were dying in their tank
my younger sister had been spraying detergent in there because she wanted to make the fish smell like lemons
i asked my boyfriend if my ass looked big in my new jeans
he looked and then started singing i like big butts and i cannot lie
i burned myself while cooking so i asked my mom to get the burn cream while i waited in the kitchen
while i was waiting i absentmindedly set my hand on the hot stove earning myself a second burn
i told my boyfriend about my foot phobia
to help me get over it he took his socks off pinned me down and rubbed his foot against my face until i started sobbing
my boyfriend and i were playing with my pet rabbit when my boyfriend discovered poop on his lap
as he brushed it off i reminded him that there are a lot worse things in the world than rabbit poop
almost as if on cue my rabbit peed on both of us
i realized that every time i hear running water i have less than a minute to find a toilet or ill pee my pants

however theyre keeping my coworker who rarely shows up and sleeps all the time when hes there
my cat sneezed directly into my open eyeball
im getting over strep throat
the antibiotics they gave me make me have diarrhea unless i eat yogurt in between each pill
that wouldnt be so bad if i wasnt lactose-intolerant
yogurt gives me really bad gas
so i have to choose between painful gas or diarrhea
while on my break at work my workmates convinced me to perform my indian accent piece
everyone laughed while i was doing it
everyone that is but my indian boss
during a dinner party some friends brought up how sweet innocent and caring they thought i was
i had to sit through my drunk boyfriend cut them off and loudly argue that i was neither sweet nor innocent and really nothing that special at all

i heard my asshole neighbor had died of a stroke
i was outside and said well its about goddamn time i turned around to see his wife walking her dog and staring deep into my soul

my parents refuse to buy any because my father can get it free from his work
hes forgotten to bring any home every day without fail for the past seven days

while we were in the middle of eating one of them asked loudly hey whatever happened to that fat bitch you dated in your third year weve been dating since his second year

iâm her daughter
my girlfriend gave herself a black eye by running into a door
to avoid being teased about her clumsiness shes telling everyone that i beat her
my boyfriend moved
he moved from my room
to my housemates room
at the supermarket my mother stopped in the middle of a lane and imitated a gorilla as a way of asking me from far away if i wanted any bananas
i went to the er after a fall
before the nurse did an x-ray she gave me a pregnancy test
it came back negative
i joked no martians have crawled into my uterus then she didnt get it and i had my head scanned for brain trauma
never crack a joke in a hospital
the girl i really liked started talking to me so i asked her out on a date
after waiting an hour at the theatre i texted her asking where she was
she replied with oh you were serious about the date
i brought my boyfriend of 2 weeks home to meet my mom and she started talking about how she really wants a lot of grand-kids
he called 2 hours later and broke up with me
i had to blow my nose
trying to be a considerate roommate i tiptoed over to the bathroom in the dark which would have been fine if i hadnt tripped over a chair and crushed the art project that shes been working on for the past month
after some filing mistakes and a lot of waiting on hold im finally registered for spring classes
i was ready to enjoy this term until i found out that my ex who was forced into therapy after he threatened to kill me is in half of my classes
i was at the grocery store with my dad
he let out a very silent but foul abomination of a fart
the people behind us started gagging so he turned pointed at me and said that was my daughter
i have a cold and need to blow my nose all the time
the problem is that every time i blow my nose i get a nosebleed
when i breathe through my mouth i have a coughing fit
so i have to choose between not breathing coughing up mucus or blowing blood
my boyfriend proposed to me with a voice card
it said marry me amber im not amber
thats his ex
my extremely lazy roommate is in bed with the flu
instead of getting up to get water hes run the garden hose through his window and instead of going to the bathroom hes connected a siphon to his penis and run it to a 5-gallon bucket
i have to live with this idiot
my friends were acting strange around me
this afternoon i got a text asking me to meet them out for a couple of drinks
because of all the strange acting i decided to tell them id go and then not go
i just found out they had been planning me a surprise party
i rode home alone on a train
i accidentally missed my stop but wasnt worried about it
my mom did not share my optimism and actually called the train company saying that i was lost and special
they thought she meant i was retarded
they wouldnt believe me when i said i wasnt
i took the time to make myself look nice just so that the pizza guy would think i had a life
i let my dogs out and then realized they didnt have their electric fence collars on
i ran inside to get the collars then dashed out to put them on my dogs
i ran through the electric fence
the collars were on
i found out that since no other procedures are working i was required to stop eating and drink a bunch of fowl tasting goo which will in turn give me constant diarrhea
this will then prepare me nicely for the long tube with a camera on the end of which will be shoved up my rectum
my friends thought itd be funny to hold lighters under the smoke alarms while i was sleeping
i was going to the bathroom at my boyfriends house
i had awful diarrhea and was almost done when i noticed a spider on the ground
being terrified i took a giant ball of toilet paper to kill it
i realized then that i had no toilet paper left to use
i drove to buy new sneakers to work out and lose weight
coming out of the store i saw someone had parked too close to me
i had to beg a stranger to back my car out for me because no matter how i tried i couldnt get into the drivers seat
i found out that its extremely difficult to take a dump while holding a cup under your ass for a lab specimen
i also found out that you get so nervous that you can actually forget to lock the door
i worked out that if i paid the minimum monthly amount on my student loans id be paying them until im 65
at work i spent half an hour on the phone with a customer
at the end of the conversation as he was putting down the phone i heard him say god he was a miserable git

he replied with great see you at 9 and hung up

his response: no you dont always get what you want

ten minutes later i went to my sent e-mails to copy and reuse an old e-mail and realized i had sent i tried calling you but your birth control is not working to a student

i got as close as i could to the spot and parked on the beach
after a few romantic hours we returned to find the car half way up the windows with water

i wrote a mental note: dont tell a couple of nuns that you used black magic to fix their computer
then dont tell the story to your boss just as the nuns walk back in again

after saying excuse me twice and being ignored i pushed my way through
after getting past i looked back and noticed she was glaring at me while signing to her friend
i dozed off during a lecture
when i woke up i didnt recognize any of the people surrounding me and i saw one guy pointing and laughing at me
it turns out my professor instructed everyone to let me sleep because he wanted to see how long it would be before i woke up
i was asleep three hours
i called my ex boyfriend to tell him that not only am i still in love with him im also three months pregnant with his child
upon hearing the news he swore called me a pathetic liar swore some more and hung up on me
i called the college of my dreams to check the status of my application

her reason i sense something horrible is going to happen
i was planning to propose
i found out how hard a lemon is to the nuts when being hurled by an angry girlfriend for losing at wii sports
i now know why my next-door neighbour cant look me in the eye without smirking

i hit a dead deer that had been left in the middle of the road
my car started to make a funny noise and smell so i pulled over to check it thinking i blew the tire on some antlers
the deer got stuck in my front wheel and id dragged it more than a mile
and it wasnt actually dead
i treated myself to a cheeseburger
i left it on my coffee table while i grabbed a napkin from the kitchen

elated that i might actually get a full night of rest for once i went to bed
just as my eyelids began to droop she started making vile hissing sounds
yes hissing
i went out to my car only to find my battery had died the night before
with the wind chill it was -20Â°f outside
with the hood open and jumper cables in one hand i tried to flag down a passing motorist for help
a man in a truck slowed down sarcastically waved at me and kept driving
my boyfriends mother who lives with us decided that since i work from home it would be a good idea for her to stay home and keep me company
keeping me company includes ordering me to make her food gossiping non stop and ridiculing me for not being the woman that she always saw her son marrying

then i hear a knock on the bathroom door
my boyfriend had decided to make a surprise visit
while in my doctors packed waiting room an elderly woman insisted i take her seat
i thanked her but politely declined
she began to yell saying i was ungrateful until i sat down
she then left laughing as i discovered that she peed in the chair
apparently she does this often
i parked three streets away despite the ungodly cold
i did this because in the past on my street i have had my car keyed my tires slashed and my side view mirror ripped off
when i went back out to my car i found that someone had broken off my windshield wipers

i sat across from a cute boy in my english class
i thought it was cute when he winked at me so i laughed and winked back

i woke up and stepped out of bed right into a pile of dog crap
acting quickly i jumped on to my other foot which would have been a great idea except for this morning there were two piles
i scraped the ice off my bosss car windows and thought itd be funny to scrape a swastika in the ice on his roof

i bought a ring only a few days ago and was planning on proposing to her
i discovered my boyfriend has been slipping me abortion pills to supplement my regular birth control
i discovered my cat frequently licks my toothbrush
i was cooking and i took a pot of boiling water to the sink to drain
my pot holder slipped and the boiling water spilled all over my breasts
second degree boob burns are bad but losing half a nipple to potato salad is worse
while driving i got a call on my cell phone
trying to be safe and avoid an accident i pulled into the nearest parking lot before answering
while i was turning in to park someone rear-ended me
my three housemates got into a huge fight and ended up declaring their undying hatred for each other
they now refuse to talk to each other and ive become their go-between
yesterday we signed the lease for another year in the house together
i was waiting for the bus while wearing my new shirt
a passer-by stopped stared at me for a moment and said i agree your life sucks
i was talking to my wife of two years on the phone when she suddenly broke down and confessed to having been cheating on me with my best friend
apparently it started 8 months ago
ive been in afghanistan for 10 months
i dropped my blackberry but thanks to the protective gel case that i just purchased for it
it bounced and fell right into a sidewalk drainage sewer
my boyfriend tried to cure me of my snake phobia by buying one
when he took it out of the cage it bit him
now hes terrified of them too
even worse he dropped the snake so its now loose in our house
i found out im pregnant
my boyfriend and i have been dying to have kids together
this would be an exciting moment if he wasnt deploying in june and will miss everything except the morning sickness
i realized that even though i was an honor student throughout school and considered the golden child who was going to go far in life all ive accomplished a year after graduation is becoming an unemployed single mother still living with my parents
i was painting my bedroom walls when i was struck with an uncontrollable bout of diarrhea
i had to watch helplessly from the en-suite bathroom as my 2 year old daughter painted a lovely picture for me all over my new $500 sofa
i was walking in the park with my girlfriend when out of nowhere i was savaged and brutally humped into submission by a massive great dane
not only did my girlfriend watch it all but the dogs owner took the time to snap a few pictures with his phone
neither bothered to help me
my girlfriend and i were playfully arguing about who loved the other more
after about a minute of this my girlfriend walked over and kicked me in the crotch as hard as she could
she then said there now you dont love me as much
i win
i decided to mock a few stuck-up runners by effortlessly jumping over the track hurdles
the last one was the easiest
the easiest to crush my balls on and twist my ankle up in the process
i walked into a room where a guy was violently picking his nose
he kept picking
a very pretty girl walked in after me and he immediately stopped and sat up straight
apparently im too ugly to motivate strangers to stop excavating their nasal cavities
i found out my dad has a 1-in-a-million disease that makes your liver process pain medication at twice the rate of a normal person
if that wasnt bad enough he also tells me he hopes i dont have it too because it can be passed down
he said this because im 29 weeks pregnant
my dad said that if i walked home from school a distance of 8 miles he would give me $50
two hours and four massive blisters later i come home
when i asked for my money he said i was kidding
i wound up in hospital because my boyfriend covered my face in fake gore while i was sleeping to see if i was really as scared of blood as i claimed
sure enough when i saw my reflection in the bathroom mirror i fainted smashing my head against the counter on the way down
i managed to convince the girl of my dreams to stop being so shy and put herself out there to get her crush to make a move
it worked
and yet as it turns out im not her crush after all
i realized i dont know which is sadder: the fact i have detailed conversations with myself in my car or that i bought a bluetooth earpiece so that i can do it in public without people thinking im a complete lunatic
i woke up to a beautiful sunrise the smell of bacon in a frying pan and some random dickhead trying to pick the lock on my front door
i told my crush of two years that i love him
he responded with an aww im sorry
and a pity hug
my friends sat me down and said they were concerned i was self-harming
i dont self-harm im just a massive klutz
they dont believe me and want me to get professional help
and now because i found it all so funny they think im mentally unhinged
i came home from a week-long vacation only to find my mother-in-law didnt just dog-sit while i was gone; she moved in along with all her possessions and seems to think its a permanent deal
on my 21st birthday a relative asked me if i was still engaged to the love of my life
the man i spent several years with gave my virginity to moved across the country for who promised to marry me before my 21st and who swore he was over his ex for good
no but thanks for asking
i was forced to look on in utter horror as an old lady backed out of her parking space kept going well past the turning point and slammed straight into my car putting a dent in the front and shattering the headlights
my boyfriend referred me to me as just a friend to his ex
they swapped phone numbers
i learned that i can work out for over an hour a day cut my daily calories by almost half keep careful track of my diet drink nothing but water and not lose a pound
but i can sure as hell gain weight after one dinner at a buffet
someone wearing dark grey clothes thought it would be a good idea to run in front of my car in the pouring rain
i slammed on my brakes and managed to stop before id have turned him into a blood sprinkler
unfortunately the person behind me didnt
i was in church
after we were done praying i quickly sat back down accidentally crushing my testicles in the process
i squealed loudly and all but pissed my pants earning me plenty of weird looks from the congregation
i managed to stab myself with a knife while trying to open something without a can opener
after getting stitches and returning back home i went to make a cup of coffee
i found the can opener in the cutlery drawer
i noticed that the injury on my hand from three weeks ago no longer hurt
a while later i accidentally slammed that same hand in a door
my girlfriend tearfully complained that i was smothering her to death with my clinginess and that i should learn to respect her boundaries
this is after she complained i wasnt giving her enough attention
while searching for the pungent odor that has been lingering in my sons bedroom i discovered various types of juice my son has been storing to make wine
after a huge row with my best friend at school i hid myself away in the bathroom and quietly sobbed to myself
a kid loudly busted into the stall next to me and took a minute-long shit that sounded like a hailstorm of bullets
the putrid stench made me retch and violently throw up everywhere
i was trying to replace the lightbulb in my bedroom
since i couldnt reach it by myself i grabbed and stood on a chair
after i got two broken bones and had stitches in my forehead i figured that using a chair with wheels probably wasnt the best idea after all
i fell going down the stairs to the subway platform during rush hour
someone was kind enough to help me up and someone else was kind enough to steal my iphone which had fallen out of my pocket and landed nearby
my dad came home drunk and called me hot
my boyfriend and i were lying in bed together and i was in a snuggly mood
i rolled over to gaze lovingly into his eyes and whisper sweet nothings to him in the darkness
his response dear god did somebody fart in your mouth
just a few minutes after i got to work my usually laconic boss came into my office and said pack your stuff and get the f*ck out
apparently half my department was being downsized
thinking it was an april fools i burst out laughing and told him how funny the prank was
he wasnt kidding
i caught my boyfriend secretly using my hair straightener while i was in the other room
too embarrassed to talk to him about it i left and came back later only to discover him slipping on a pair of my panties
i was dumped by my boyfriend
were currently sharing a room on a cruise ship
my friend called me at work to tell me that someone had hit my motorcycle and that it was in pretty bad shape
i chuckled and waited for the april fools that would follow
a picture of my wrecked bike came instead
i was out enjoying my daily jog when out of nowhere a group of kids in a passing car pelted me with ketchup-filled water balloons
i found out that my dog is so lazy she doesnt even get out of my bed in the morning to poop
i gave up my seat on the subway for an elderly man
he thanked me by grabbing my ass
i learned that when i leave skid marks in the toilet my wife uses my toothbrush to remove them
i asked my 2 year old son to clean up his toys
when i bent down to give him a good job kiss afterwards he punched me in the nose
my ex fiancÃ©e who left me six months ago asked if id mind if she used the wedding dress i bought her for our wedding
shes just gotten engaged again
while shopping i was grabbed and dragged off to a security room with no warning
apparently the way i was dressed and walking was suspicious
i was reading my boyfriends online diary
it started off really sweet saying he was in a wonderful relationship with me and how he utterly adored me
it then slowly progressed into loathing and wondering what he ever saw in me all because i have a low sex-drive
i attended a funeral
during the minute of silence my phone went off
my ringtone is its good to be alive
i was in ikea when my friends and i thought it would be fun to play hide and seek
we all hid; i was in a good hiding spot
half an hour later i was still there
i texted my friends to see where they were
they all left to see a movie and forgot about me
i went with my beautiful fiancÃ©e to tell her grandmother whos a bit senile that we were engaged
her response: i know hes very nice but think about the chubby little ugly children hell give you
this was followed by a recollection of her ex-boyfriends who wouldve fathered attractive kids
my wife told me that she was leaving me for someone with more hair
i was in the shower grooming myself for my second anniversary with my boyfriend
halfway through the hot water ran out
i now have the choice of going with the low half-fro or risking hypothermia
my boyfriend thinks hypothermia would be the better option
amazon didnt deliver the present i bought my mother for mothering sunday so she called me an ungrateful bastard
and about half an hour ago i cut my thumb whilst making her lunch
she said youre doing this on purpose so i feel sorry for you
well i dont
while bending over to get the brownies i was making out of the oven my husband slapped my butt
i fell into the oven
sun was shining and i felt confident enough to go sunbathing at the beach
in only my bikini and towel i laid out to get some sun
a while later a little girl came up to me and said arent you embarrassed that youre so huge
my girlfriend called me and asked what i was doing
i replied what im always doing
she couldnt think of anything besides eating
i was awoken by my dad yelling into my ear
in shock i jumped up off the couch and came smashing down into the coffee table
my roommate thought it would be a good idea to show me his huge new tarantula despite knowing that i have extremely severe arachnophobia
i ended up killing it with a book and apparently now owe him $500
i was at a grocery store with my 3 year old son
as i was picking a cereal out an older man comes over and says you should have used condoms

i went up to a girl at a bus stop and started chatting her up
her response am i being robbed

she was visiting him to complain about how terrible a person i am
i was watching animal planet while babysitting my 4 year-old niece
a really cute baby bunny came on and i called her into the room only for her to see it get killed by a bald eagle
now she wont stop crying
i was excited about being set up on a blind date by one of my new co-workers
it turns out the guy she thought would be a totally perfect match for me is the ex who cheated on me
i found out that my mom and dad got a divorce
they didnt tell me they just changed their relationship status on facebook
my fiancÃ© and i visited his family for dinner
the entire time i was there his mother and sister had an in depth conversation about how attractive his ex girlfriends were and how they got along with them so well
my dad woke me up for the second time to get me ready for school
wanting me to prove i was really awake he made me sit up
as soon as he left my room i dozed off and faceplanted my nightstand
i returned home to find the key to my mailbox missing
i called the post office and was informed that a new key will cost me $15
i have no money and my paycheck is in the mailbox
i was walking home through the slush and snow when a car drove by soaking me with dirty water
frustrated i flipped him off
he then turned around and splashed me again
i heard that one of our customers had passed away
saddened i told everyone who came into our shop about his death

i received an abusive phone call from my boss saying he shouldnt have to cover my lazy ass

my four year old daughter came up to me with her finger in her ear
she then let me know that her earwax tasted better than the dinner i made
in front of my whole family
i arrived twenty minutes early for my opening shift at work so i decided to turn on the radio and wait in my nice warm car
i woke up two hours later with twelve missed calls from my boss and a dead car battery
i told my boss i was too sick to come to work
he asked if i had a late night so i told him i stayed in
apparently i ran into him at a bar last night and was too drunk to remember it
i went to a baseball game
it was windy so i decided to get my hat from the car trunk
when i opened it and reached in loose papers started flying everywhere
panicked my dad slammed the trunk shut on my fingers

he decided it would be a good idea to hide my diabetes medication
while relaxing in the kitchen drinking coffee my dad suddenly rushed in knocking me over and causing me to spill boiling hot coffee all over myself
then my dad thought it would be a good idea to grab the sprayer from the sink and douse me with cold water in order to put me out
i got hurt and spent the remainder of the day limping
i wish i could say it was from something badass like roller derby but i cant

when i asked him if he felt ok he threw up all over my gown
i think he had some broccoli today
i got a call from a girl i was seeing
she said that she was falling for someone else but she still liked me and couldnt decide what to do
being the romantic (idiot) i am i told her that she should do what would make her happiest thinking that she would pick me

he thinks this is acceptable behavior
i was putting red nail polish on my nails and put a newspaper on the table to make sure that it didnt spill
i later discovered the nail polish made the newspaper stick to the table
i scrubbed nail polish remover on it thinking it would help but instead bleached the table
my family and i discovered that my sleepwalking has escalated into sleep-raiding-the-fridge after i woke up on my kitchen floor in a puddle of melted ice cream surrounded by my parents brother and dogs

he attacked us
i was taking a crap in a public stall when three kids broke down the door and pelted me with eggs

i went shopping for a nice outfit to wear for a job interview
a fake job interview
one that i just made up so my mother would get off my case about finding a job
i dont know which is sadder the fact that i cant get a job or that my mother actually believed me about the interview
at work i spent half an hour trying to convince an elderly customer that no i wasnt a messenger sent by the devil to take her soul to hell
its been 5 years ive been working for a man that wont admit he has tourettes
he sits at his desk twitching his head and hissing like a snake

i feel like its become my job to warn new employees
i paid Â£140 for a train ticket
