my husbands old fraternity brother came to visit
he fell out of his car puked then passed out drunk in our driveway
we got him to the bathroom where he fell asleep
he woke up at 4am wandered around the house naked pooped in my trash can then passed out again
i found out that my beautiful engagement ring is a remake of the late princess dianas engagement ring
i also found out my fiance bought it from an infomercial for $19
my ex-girlfriend came over to console me after a breakup
after beating me repeatedly in mariokart she decided to leave
the alarm clock downstairs has been going off since 3am
the apartment belongs to two other students
theyve gone home
only 3 more days left to go
i was at my friends house
we were looking at her dads guns and i was explaining gun safety and how you should never put your finger on the trigger
i then shot a hole in the floor of her house
i went for a drive with my boyfriend and his dad
his dad was kind enough to point out at every opportunity girls that would be better for him than me
while sitting next to the cute guy in my english class i had to sneeze
i turned away from him and sneezed into my arm
my long hair got in the way and i accidently shot a huge snot rocket into my hair
i spent the rest of the class trying to get it out without him noticing
i went to the store and ran into an old friend that i hadnt seen in years
we chatted a little and just as i was leaving he grabbed his mobile phone
later i added him on facebook
turns out the last thing he posted was a picture of my back saying: look who got even fatter
it was my first day back to school after break
i wasnt feeling well but i decided to go anyway
i threw up in the hallway and shit myself at the same time
i waited in the office for my dad to come and get me for almost an hour while wearing dirty underwear
i found out that my friend makes more money than i do
shes a high school dropout and working at a retail job at the mall
i went to college for four years to get my job
while changing my clothes my 3 year old daughter informed me that i looked like a zebra
noticing my shocked face she tried comforting me by telling me i was a pretty zebra because i was a purple zebra
she was talking about my stretch marks
my boyfriend told me there was a tick on my shoulder and that he would remove it so i shouldnt worry
after about a half hour lots of blood and a ton of pain he told me it was just a mole
my boss and i were stacking boxes in the back room of the store
one of the boxes fell and hit me in the face causing me to lose my glasses
my boss stepped on my glasses as she ran to check the box for broken merchandise which i then had to pay for
i was woken up by the sound of part of my kitchen ceiling hitting the floor
i had a job interview
the interviewer asked me to give 5 adjectives describing myself
i listed 7
the last one being listener
my girlfriend dumped me for the tattoo artist who gave us our matching love tattoos
i discovered after four hours of vomiting that it is very much possible to vomit so hard you cant help but shit in your trousers
my boyfriend is currently staying over too
between my cats scratching every surface they can find my boyfriends snoring and the dog barking at every slight noise outside im unlikely to ever get more than 3 hours of sleep at a time
i took my daughter to the library instead of the pool
i sat her on the counter and while i reached for my library card she turned to the librarian and said we didnt go to the pool today because mum has hairy legs
my girlfriend whom im crazy about broke up with me out of the blue
after pleading with her unsuccessfully i called my mom for comfort and advice
she informed me that my dog had died
while walking on the sidewalk with my boyfriend i slipped and fell
not only did he not help me get up or ask if i was okay he got mad at me for embarrassing him in public
i was talking to my boyfriend about our new years resolutions
i started telling him that i wanted to lose some weight
he interrupted me saying yeah yeah we all know youre fat whatever
he then went on a 30 minute speech about how hed really like to take more pictures of his cat in 2011
my boyfriend decided to re-enact a scene from family guy
he locked me in the car with him and farted deadly ones repeatedly
he wouldnt let me out until i learned to love the gas
i hit a parked car which was sticking out in the road and practically unavoidable
i left a note on the windshield saying you deserved to get hit - you park like an asshole
later i realized that the paper i tore to write on was the back of my bank statement name and address included
i was out running
all of a sudden i saw a dog come towards me i thought it was going to attack me and i screamed like a girl in front of everyone
it was a puppy wanting to play
it was opening night for the play where i was for the first time ever one of the leads
i went on stage with a loud and energetic entrance
i came in two scenes early
i was talking to a really cute guy
he leaned closer and i thought he was going to kiss me
instead he leaned back laughed and said wow
youre growing a mustache
my boss walked in and said something i didnt quite hear but my co-worker chuckled so to be polite i laughed with him
they gave me some weird looks
my boss was actually talking about his wifes tumor and my co-worker was coughing
i found out my identity was stolen
the person got credit cards in my name and didnt pay the bills which has ruined my near perfect credit
the worst part about all of this is that i cant turn the person in
its my mom and sending her to jail wouldnt really work out for anyone
while i was out of the office id left my phone charging inside
my boss informed me that since i am clearly running up her electricity bill it will be deducted out of my already nearly non existent paycheck
i was driving back from school 100 miles away from my home with my fiancÃ© and dog
while stopping for gas we accidentally left our car keys and cell phones in the car
the dog sat on one of the keys and engaged the locks
we were locked out of the car until the tow truck arrived
i returned to work after celebrating the new year in mexico
i wasnt feeling well but didnt want to call in sick after already taking a vacation
now im at work with diarrhea and trotting to the bathroom every 30 minutes
my commute home usually takes around an hour
at work my computer started acting up
i told my boss i could fix it but he told me to call the it department instead
neither the it technician or his supervisor could figure it out so i showed them what was wrong and how to fix it
i was promptly fired for wasting 2 hours of company time
my mother came over again to help me work on my student aid application
she also brought over the savings bonds that she has been accumulating since i was born to help pay for college
turns out they wont reach maturity until im thirty
she never bothered to check out this fact
im screwed for college
i have been teaching my 5 year-old step-daughter how to read and write
she came bounding up to me with a piece of paper and said look what i did
it was a letter that said my dad misses my real mommy not you
i changed my facebook relationship status to in a relationship
the girl is made up and the picture is from google
my cheating ex-boyfriend was offered the job we both interviewed for
i helped him with his cover letter before i found out about the affair
ive been unemployed for almost two years
i was feeling sick but went into my waitressing job because id already missed 3 days this week
i was dizzy and managed to spill a tray of drinks all over the customers
then when their food was done i tripped and spilled hot chili all over the mans lap
i was at the doctors getting some skin scraped off the bottom of my foot for some tests
as soon as the doctor grabbed my foot it tickled and i accidentally kicked him in the face
during this the blade sliced my foot open
i found the birthday card my grandma had mailed
apparently it contained a gift of $100
too bad it was in my moms trash can opened with no money
she told my grandma it must have gotten lost in the mail
i had a panic attack at 2am because someone decided to throw a snowball at my window
i was at the nursing home i work at and my boss asked me if im serious about my job telling me that ive been acting strange and not working hard enough
she wants to drug test me
the real reason im not 100% is because i have a stomach ulcer from the stress of working there
i had a plaster cast removed from my arm
after telling the nurse it felt like the saw was cutting my skin she tells me there is no way that it could touch my skin and that i was being paranoid
she cracked open the cast
burns blisters and bleeding skin were revealed
i had a show with my drama group
my mom isnt a good drunk she decided to scream along to every song and pass out halfway through
she was in the front row
for the first time ever my boyfriend of one year told me he loved me
he was calling me by collect call from the county jail
i went to the toilet during drama not because i had to actually go but because i wanted to play monopoly on my ipod
i lost track of time and came back twenty minutes later
my whole class listened while i was forced to tell my teacher id been really constipated
in gym class we were forced to learn the hoedown throwdown dance by miley cyrus
this will actually be counted toward my grade
im in high school
a kid grabbed the receiver to my cochlear implant and ran off with it
i went to a security guard and if my lip reading was accurate he said to try and make it through the day without it
without it i cant hear anything
i fell and got a nasty cut above my right eye
the doctor in the er sealed the wound with surgical glue
he also glued his glove to my eyebrow and let glue run onto my eyelid
not only do i have a scar and medical bill i now have no eyebrow or eyelashes on my right eye
feeling melancholy i took a blanket out to the backyard and lay down to look at the clouds
my dad came out to ask me what i was doing
i told him he smirked squatted over my face and farted
he then ran back inside and told my mom
she laughed
after lifting a 20 pound box of oranges for a woman at work she turned around to say your acne needs help
i still had to tell her to have a good day
my 2 year-old son decided to pee on the dog for the second day in a row
im afraid this will turn into a routine thing
i had to walk three miles home from work
both my parents were at home
the reason they wouldnt collect me is apparently because ive gotten so fat your grandma cried after she saw you
i got diarrhea while on a trip with my daughters
at our third stop i had to sit in the stall listening to my 5 year-old informing everyone who came in that mommy is stopping at every bathroom to poop
my boyfriend broke up with me via text message
you would think he could at least spell my name right while ending our relationship
at work i was asked to sharpen some pencils
im an electronics and mechanics engineer and while i understand its been quite a while since i was in primary school i still wonder why my boss felt the need to explain in minute detail how to sharpen a pencil
i was on the plane asleep
i woke up after feeling the plane jolt and i screamed at the top of my lungs
the little girl next to me told me i was a sissy
everyone on the plane laughed
i finally found out why my fish were dying in their tank
my younger sister had been spraying detergent in there because she wanted to make the fish smell like lemons
i asked my boyfriend if my ass looked big in my new jeans
he looked and then started singing i like big butts and i cannot lie
i burned myself while cooking so i asked my mom to get the burn cream while i waited in the kitchen
while i was waiting i absentmindedly set my hand on the hot stove earning myself a second burn
i told my boyfriend about my foot phobia
to help me get over it he took his socks off pinned me down and rubbed his foot against my face until i started sobbing
my boyfriend and i were playing with my pet rabbit when my boyfriend discovered poop on his lap
as he brushed it off i reminded him that there are a lot worse things in the world than rabbit poop
almost as if on cue my rabbit peed on both of us
i realized that every time i hear running water i have less than a minute to find a toilet or ill pee my pants

however theyre keeping my coworker who rarely shows up and sleeps all the time when hes there
my cat sneezed directly into my open eyeball
im getting over strep throat
the antibiotics they gave me make me have diarrhea unless i eat yogurt in between each pill
that wouldnt be so bad if i wasnt lactose-intolerant
yogurt gives me really bad gas
so i have to choose between painful gas or diarrhea
while on my break at work my workmates convinced me to perform my indian accent piece
everyone laughed while i was doing it
everyone that is but my indian boss
during a dinner party some friends brought up how sweet innocent and caring they thought i was
i had to sit through my drunk boyfriend cut them off and loudly argue that i was neither sweet nor innocent and really nothing that special at all

i heard my asshole neighbor had died of a stroke
i was outside and said well its about goddamn time i turned around to see his wife walking her dog and staring deep into my soul

my parents refuse to buy any because my father can get it free from his work
hes forgotten to bring any home every day without fail for the past seven days

while we were in the middle of eating one of them asked loudly hey whatever happened to that fat bitch you dated in your third year weve been dating since his second year

iâm her daughter
my girlfriend gave herself a black eye by running into a door
to avoid being teased about her clumsiness shes telling everyone that i beat her
my boyfriend moved
he moved from my room
to my housemates room
at the supermarket my mother stopped in the middle of a lane and imitated a gorilla as a way of asking me from far away if i wanted any bananas
i went to the er after a fall
before the nurse did an x-ray she gave me a pregnancy test
it came back negative
i joked no martians have crawled into my uterus then she didnt get it and i had my head scanned for brain trauma
never crack a joke in a hospital
the girl i really liked started talking to me so i asked her out on a date
after waiting an hour at the theatre i texted her asking where she was
she replied with oh you were serious about the date
i brought my boyfriend of 2 weeks home to meet my mom and she started talking about how she really wants a lot of grand-kids
he called 2 hours later and broke up with me
i had to blow my nose
trying to be a considerate roommate i tiptoed over to the bathroom in the dark which would have been fine if i hadnt tripped over a chair and crushed the art project that shes been working on for the past month
after some filing mistakes and a lot of waiting on hold im finally registered for spring classes
i was ready to enjoy this term until i found out that my ex who was forced into therapy after he threatened to kill me is in half of my classes
i was at the grocery store with my dad
he let out a very silent but foul abomination of a fart
the people behind us started gagging so he turned pointed at me and said that was my daughter
i have a cold and need to blow my nose all the time
the problem is that every time i blow my nose i get a nosebleed
when i breathe through my mouth i have a coughing fit
so i have to choose between not breathing coughing up mucus or blowing blood
my boyfriend proposed to me with a voice card
it said marry me amber im not amber
thats his ex
my extremely lazy roommate is in bed with the flu
instead of getting up to get water hes run the garden hose through his window and instead of going to the bathroom hes connected a siphon to his penis and run it to a 5-gallon bucket
i have to live with this idiot
my friends were acting strange around me
this afternoon i got a text asking me to meet them out for a couple of drinks
because of all the strange acting i decided to tell them id go and then not go
i just found out they had been planning me a surprise party
i rode home alone on a train
i accidentally missed my stop but wasnt worried about it
my mom did not share my optimism and actually called the train company saying that i was lost and special
they thought she meant i was retarded
they wouldnt believe me when i said i wasnt
i took the time to make myself look nice just so that the pizza guy would think i had a life
i let my dogs out and then realized they didnt have their electric fence collars on
i ran inside to get the collars then dashed out to put them on my dogs
i ran through the electric fence
the collars were on
i found out that since no other procedures are working i was required to stop eating and drink a bunch of fowl tasting goo which will in turn give me constant diarrhea
this will then prepare me nicely for the long tube with a camera on the end of which will be shoved up my rectum
my friends thought itd be funny to hold lighters under the smoke alarms while i was sleeping
i was going to the bathroom at my boyfriends house
i had awful diarrhea and was almost done when i noticed a spider on the ground
being terrified i took a giant ball of toilet paper to kill it
i realized then that i had no toilet paper left to use
i drove to buy new sneakers to work out and lose weight
coming out of the store i saw someone had parked too close to me
i had to beg a stranger to back my car out for me because no matter how i tried i couldnt get into the drivers seat
i found out that its extremely difficult to take a dump while holding a cup under your ass for a lab specimen
i also found out that you get so nervous that you can actually forget to lock the door
i worked out that if i paid the minimum monthly amount on my student loans id be paying them until im 65
at work i spent half an hour on the phone with a customer
at the end of the conversation as he was putting down the phone i heard him say god he was a miserable git

he replied with great see you at 9 and hung up

his response: no you dont always get what you want

ten minutes later i went to my sent e-mails to copy and reuse an old e-mail and realized i had sent i tried calling you but your birth control is not working to a student

i got as close as i could to the spot and parked on the beach
after a few romantic hours we returned to find the car half way up the windows with water

i wrote a mental note: dont tell a couple of nuns that you used black magic to fix their computer
then dont tell the story to your boss just as the nuns walk back in again

after saying excuse me twice and being ignored i pushed my way through
after getting past i looked back and noticed she was glaring at me while signing to her friend
i dozed off during a lecture
when i woke up i didnt recognize any of the people surrounding me and i saw one guy pointing and laughing at me
it turns out my professor instructed everyone to let me sleep because he wanted to see how long it would be before i woke up
i was asleep three hours
i called my ex boyfriend to tell him that not only am i still in love with him im also three months pregnant with his child
upon hearing the news he swore called me a pathetic liar swore some more and hung up on me
i called the college of my dreams to check the status of my application

her reason i sense something horrible is going to happen
i was planning to propose
i found out how hard a lemon is to the nuts when being hurled by an angry girlfriend for losing at wii sports
i now know why my next-door neighbour cant look me in the eye without smirking

i hit a dead deer that had been left in the middle of the road
my car started to make a funny noise and smell so i pulled over to check it thinking i blew the tire on some antlers
the deer got stuck in my front wheel and id dragged it more than a mile
and it wasnt actually dead
i treated myself to a cheeseburger
i left it on my coffee table while i grabbed a napkin from the kitchen

elated that i might actually get a full night of rest for once i went to bed
just as my eyelids began to droop she started making vile hissing sounds
yes hissing
i went out to my car only to find my battery had died the night before
with the wind chill it was -20Â°f outside
with the hood open and jumper cables in one hand i tried to flag down a passing motorist for help
a man in a truck slowed down sarcastically waved at me and kept driving
my boyfriends mother who lives with us decided that since i work from home it would be a good idea for her to stay home and keep me company
keeping me company includes ordering me to make her food gossiping non stop and ridiculing me for not being the woman that she always saw her son marrying

then i hear a knock on the bathroom door
my boyfriend had decided to make a surprise visit
while in my doctors packed waiting room an elderly woman insisted i take her seat
i thanked her but politely declined
she began to yell saying i was ungrateful until i sat down
she then left laughing as i discovered that she peed in the chair
apparently she does this often
i parked three streets away despite the ungodly cold
i did this because in the past on my street i have had my car keyed my tires slashed and my side view mirror ripped off
when i went back out to my car i found that someone had broken off my windshield wipers

i sat across from a cute boy in my english class
i thought it was cute when he winked at me so i laughed and winked back

i woke up and stepped out of bed right into a pile of dog crap
acting quickly i jumped on to my other foot which would have been a great idea except for this morning there were two piles
i scraped the ice off my bosss car windows and thought itd be funny to scrape a swastika in the ice on his roof

i bought a ring only a few days ago and was planning on proposing to her
i discovered my boyfriend has been slipping me abortion pills to supplement my regular birth control
i discovered my cat frequently licks my toothbrush
i was cooking and i took a pot of boiling water to the sink to drain
my pot holder slipped and the boiling water spilled all over my breasts
second degree boob burns are bad but losing half a nipple to potato salad is worse
while driving i got a call on my cell phone
trying to be safe and avoid an accident i pulled into the nearest parking lot before answering
while i was turning in to park someone rear-ended me
my three housemates got into a huge fight and ended up declaring their undying hatred for each other
they now refuse to talk to each other and ive become their go-between
yesterday we signed the lease for another year in the house together
i was waiting for the bus while wearing my new shirt
a passer-by stopped stared at me for a moment and said i agree your life sucks
i was talking to my wife of two years on the phone when she suddenly broke down and confessed to having been cheating on me with my best friend
apparently it started 8 months ago
ive been in afghanistan for 10 months
i dropped my blackberry but thanks to the protective gel case that i just purchased for it
it bounced and fell right into a sidewalk drainage sewer
my boyfriend tried to cure me of my snake phobia by buying one
when he took it out of the cage it bit him
now hes terrified of them too
even worse he dropped the snake so its now loose in our house
i found out im pregnant
my boyfriend and i have been dying to have kids together
this would be an exciting moment if he wasnt deploying in june and will miss everything except the morning sickness
i realized that even though i was an honor student throughout school and considered the golden child who was going to go far in life all ive accomplished a year after graduation is becoming an unemployed single mother still living with my parents
i was painting my bedroom walls when i was struck with an uncontrollable bout of diarrhea
i had to watch helplessly from the en-suite bathroom as my 2 year old daughter painted a lovely picture for me all over my new $500 sofa
i was walking in the park with my girlfriend when out of nowhere i was savaged and brutally humped into submission by a massive great dane
not only did my girlfriend watch it all but the dogs owner took the time to snap a few pictures with his phone
neither bothered to help me
my girlfriend and i were playfully arguing about who loved the other more
after about a minute of this my girlfriend walked over and kicked me in the crotch as hard as she could
she then said there now you dont love me as much
i win
i decided to mock a few stuck-up runners by effortlessly jumping over the track hurdles
the last one was the easiest
the easiest to crush my balls on and twist my ankle up in the process
i walked into a room where a guy was violently picking his nose
he kept picking
a very pretty girl walked in after me and he immediately stopped and sat up straight
apparently im too ugly to motivate strangers to stop excavating their nasal cavities
i found out my dad has a 1-in-a-million disease that makes your liver process pain medication at twice the rate of a normal person
if that wasnt bad enough he also tells me he hopes i dont have it too because it can be passed down
he said this because im 29 weeks pregnant
my dad said that if i walked home from school a distance of 8 miles he would give me $50
two hours and four massive blisters later i come home
when i asked for my money he said i was kidding
i wound up in hospital because my boyfriend covered my face in fake gore while i was sleeping to see if i was really as scared of blood as i claimed
sure enough when i saw my reflection in the bathroom mirror i fainted smashing my head against the counter on the way down
i managed to convince the girl of my dreams to stop being so shy and put herself out there to get her crush to make a move
it worked
and yet as it turns out im not her crush after all
i realized i dont know which is sadder: the fact i have detailed conversations with myself in my car or that i bought a bluetooth earpiece so that i can do it in public without people thinking im a complete lunatic
i woke up to a beautiful sunrise the smell of bacon in a frying pan and some random dickhead trying to pick the lock on my front door
i told my crush of two years that i love him
he responded with an aww im sorry
and a pity hug
my friends sat me down and said they were concerned i was self-harming
i dont self-harm im just a massive klutz
they dont believe me and want me to get professional help
and now because i found it all so funny they think im mentally unhinged
i came home from a week-long vacation only to find my mother-in-law didnt just dog-sit while i was gone; she moved in along with all her possessions and seems to think its a permanent deal
on my 21st birthday a relative asked me if i was still engaged to the love of my life
the man i spent several years with gave my virginity to moved across the country for who promised to marry me before my 21st and who swore he was over his ex for good
no but thanks for asking
i was forced to look on in utter horror as an old lady backed out of her parking space kept going well past the turning point and slammed straight into my car putting a dent in the front and shattering the headlights
my boyfriend referred me to me as just a friend to his ex
they swapped phone numbers
i learned that i can work out for over an hour a day cut my daily calories by almost half keep careful track of my diet drink nothing but water and not lose a pound
but i can sure as hell gain weight after one dinner at a buffet
someone wearing dark grey clothes thought it would be a good idea to run in front of my car in the pouring rain
i slammed on my brakes and managed to stop before id have turned him into a blood sprinkler
unfortunately the person behind me didnt
i was in church
after we were done praying i quickly sat back down accidentally crushing my testicles in the process
i squealed loudly and all but pissed my pants earning me plenty of weird looks from the congregation
i managed to stab myself with a knife while trying to open something without a can opener
after getting stitches and returning back home i went to make a cup of coffee
i found the can opener in the cutlery drawer
i noticed that the injury on my hand from three weeks ago no longer hurt
a while later i accidentally slammed that same hand in a door
my girlfriend tearfully complained that i was smothering her to death with my clinginess and that i should learn to respect her boundaries
this is after she complained i wasnt giving her enough attention
while searching for the pungent odor that has been lingering in my sons bedroom i discovered various types of juice my son has been storing to make wine
after a huge row with my best friend at school i hid myself away in the bathroom and quietly sobbed to myself
a kid loudly busted into the stall next to me and took a minute-long shit that sounded like a hailstorm of bullets
the putrid stench made me retch and violently throw up everywhere
i was trying to replace the lightbulb in my bedroom
since i couldnt reach it by myself i grabbed and stood on a chair
after i got two broken bones and had stitches in my forehead i figured that using a chair with wheels probably wasnt the best idea after all
i fell going down the stairs to the subway platform during rush hour
someone was kind enough to help me up and someone else was kind enough to steal my iphone which had fallen out of my pocket and landed nearby
my dad came home drunk and called me hot
my boyfriend and i were lying in bed together and i was in a snuggly mood
i rolled over to gaze lovingly into his eyes and whisper sweet nothings to him in the darkness
his response dear god did somebody fart in your mouth
just a few minutes after i got to work my usually laconic boss came into my office and said pack your stuff and get the f*ck out
apparently half my department was being downsized
thinking it was an april fools i burst out laughing and told him how funny the prank was
he wasnt kidding
i caught my boyfriend secretly using my hair straightener while i was in the other room
too embarrassed to talk to him about it i left and came back later only to discover him slipping on a pair of my panties
i was dumped by my boyfriend
were currently sharing a room on a cruise ship
my friend called me at work to tell me that someone had hit my motorcycle and that it was in pretty bad shape
i chuckled and waited for the april fools that would follow
a picture of my wrecked bike came instead
i was out enjoying my daily jog when out of nowhere a group of kids in a passing car pelted me with ketchup-filled water balloons
i found out that my dog is so lazy she doesnt even get out of my bed in the morning to poop
i gave up my seat on the subway for an elderly man
he thanked me by grabbing my ass
i learned that when i leave skid marks in the toilet my wife uses my toothbrush to remove them
i asked my 2 year old son to clean up his toys
when i bent down to give him a good job kiss afterwards he punched me in the nose
my ex fiancÃ©e who left me six months ago asked if id mind if she used the wedding dress i bought her for our wedding
shes just gotten engaged again
while shopping i was grabbed and dragged off to a security room with no warning
apparently the way i was dressed and walking was suspicious
i was reading my boyfriends online diary
it started off really sweet saying he was in a wonderful relationship with me and how he utterly adored me
it then slowly progressed into loathing and wondering what he ever saw in me all because i have a low sex-drive
i attended a funeral
during the minute of silence my phone went off
my ringtone is its good to be alive
i was in ikea when my friends and i thought it would be fun to play hide and seek
we all hid; i was in a good hiding spot
half an hour later i was still there
i texted my friends to see where they were
they all left to see a movie and forgot about me
i went with my beautiful fiancÃ©e to tell her grandmother whos a bit senile that we were engaged
her response: i know hes very nice but think about the chubby little ugly children hell give you
this was followed by a recollection of her ex-boyfriends who wouldve fathered attractive kids
my wife told me that she was leaving me for someone with more hair
i was in the shower grooming myself for my second anniversary with my boyfriend
halfway through the hot water ran out
i now have the choice of going with the low half-fro or risking hypothermia
my boyfriend thinks hypothermia would be the better option
amazon didnt deliver the present i bought my mother for mothering sunday so she called me an ungrateful bastard
and about half an hour ago i cut my thumb whilst making her lunch
she said youre doing this on purpose so i feel sorry for you
well i dont
while bending over to get the brownies i was making out of the oven my husband slapped my butt
i fell into the oven
sun was shining and i felt confident enough to go sunbathing at the beach
in only my bikini and towel i laid out to get some sun
a while later a little girl came up to me and said arent you embarrassed that youre so huge
my girlfriend called me and asked what i was doing
i replied what im always doing
she couldnt think of anything besides eating
i was awoken by my dad yelling into my ear
in shock i jumped up off the couch and came smashing down into the coffee table
my roommate thought it would be a good idea to show me his huge new tarantula despite knowing that i have extremely severe arachnophobia
i ended up killing it with a book and apparently now owe him $500
i was at a grocery store with my 3 year old son
as i was picking a cereal out an older man comes over and says you should have used condoms

i went up to a girl at a bus stop and started chatting her up
her response am i being robbed

she was visiting him to complain about how terrible a person i am
i was watching animal planet while babysitting my 4 year-old niece
a really cute baby bunny came on and i called her into the room only for her to see it get killed by a bald eagle
now she wont stop crying
i was excited about being set up on a blind date by one of my new co-workers
it turns out the guy she thought would be a totally perfect match for me is the ex who cheated on me
i found out that my mom and dad got a divorce
they didnt tell me they just changed their relationship status on facebook
my fiancÃ© and i visited his family for dinner
the entire time i was there his mother and sister had an in depth conversation about how attractive his ex girlfriends were and how they got along with them so well
my dad woke me up for the second time to get me ready for school
wanting me to prove i was really awake he made me sit up
as soon as he left my room i dozed off and faceplanted my nightstand
i returned home to find the key to my mailbox missing
i called the post office and was informed that a new key will cost me $15
i have no money and my paycheck is in the mailbox
i was walking home through the slush and snow when a car drove by soaking me with dirty water
frustrated i flipped him off
he then turned around and splashed me again
i heard that one of our customers had passed away
saddened i told everyone who came into our shop about his death

i received an abusive phone call from my boss saying he shouldnt have to cover my lazy ass

my four year old daughter came up to me with her finger in her ear
she then let me know that her earwax tasted better than the dinner i made
in front of my whole family
i arrived twenty minutes early for my opening shift at work so i decided to turn on the radio and wait in my nice warm car
i woke up two hours later with twelve missed calls from my boss and a dead car battery
i told my boss i was too sick to come to work
he asked if i had a late night so i told him i stayed in
apparently i ran into him at a bar last night and was too drunk to remember it
i went to a baseball game
it was windy so i decided to get my hat from the car trunk
when i opened it and reached in loose papers started flying everywhere
panicked my dad slammed the trunk shut on my fingers

she said no but also attempted to make me feel better by saying that with my eye my acne was unnoticeable
my boss friend requested me on facebook
my profile picture is of me licking his employee of the month picture for a dare

the only person to tell me happy birthday was the cop who pulled me over as he handed me my ticket

my wife and i were planning our nursery for our future child
she said that wed be painting it pink either way
i asked what would happen if we had a boy
she said oh hell be gay with a menacing glare
im worried
after receiving the third call this week from teachers about my son falling asleep in class i decided that it would be a good idea to hide his xbox controllers
he decided it would be a good idea to hide my diabetes medication
while relaxing in the kitchen drinking coffee my dad suddenly rushed in knocking me over and causing me to spill boiling hot coffee all over myself
then my dad thought it would be a good idea to grab the sprayer from the sink and douse me with cold water in order to put me out
i got hurt and spent the remainder of the day limping
i wish i could say it was from something badass like roller derby but i cant
a woman with a rolling cart filled with packs of pepsi rolled over my foot on the bus
my boyfriend and i shared our first kiss
his partly digested nachos decided to make an appearance halfway through
i had to take a mandatory drug test with the doctor present
nervous i couldnt get myself to pee in the cup right away

i had an all day volleyball tournament in a town an hour away
my dad left early not realizing he was my ride home
im now stranded in the middle of a rural town with no way home anytime soon
i was pretending to be an angry bear while babysitting a 3 year old boy and an 19 month old girl

i got a postcard from my boyfriend who is on vacation in the caribbean

i was cutting a little boys hair at the hairdressers where i work

when i asked him if he felt ok he threw up all over my gown
i think he had some broccoli today
i got a call from a girl i was seeing
she said that she was falling for someone else but she still liked me and couldnt decide what to do
being the romantic (idiot) i am i told her that she should do what would make her happiest thinking that she would pick me
she didnt
i thought it would be funny to tickle my daughters foot which she hates
one bloody nose multiple scratches and 4 toe-shaped bruises later shes the one laughing
i was fired from my job
apparently getting shot is no valid reason to stay home

i watched free willy with my daughter
later on she decided to free her 6 pet mice into the house
i woke up to a strange sound that sounded like a lot of water being poured into a sink
it was actually my father in law using the bathtub as a toilet
hes staying with us and is showing no signs of leaving any time soon
he thinks this is acceptable behavior
i was putting red nail polish on my nails and put a newspaper on the table to make sure that it didnt spill
i later discovered the nail polish made the newspaper stick to the table
i scrubbed nail polish remover on it thinking it would help but instead bleached the table
my family and i discovered that my sleepwalking has escalated into sleep-raiding-the-fridge after i woke up on my kitchen floor in a puddle of melted ice cream surrounded by my parents brother and dogs
apparently my recent dieting plans arent going over too well with my subconscious
i told my son that his grades are dropping and his behavior is getting out of hand
to which he replied yeah so is your weight
while enjoying a nice dinner out i observed a homeless man giggling hysterically to himself while wiping boogers on my bike seat and handlebars
i realised that what i had thought was my dads default state for the past 17 years is actually his drunken state
my friend and i were bouncing around on a trampoline
we brought my dog up to bounce him around
we found it hilarious
he didnt
he attacked us
i was taking a crap in a public stall when three kids broke down the door and pelted me with eggs
as i was out walking one homeless man sitting with two others asked me for something to eat
trying to do a good deed i bought the three men a bag of apples
they then fought viciously over them before the first man chased me for handing them to the wrong one
i walked into the laundry room when my mom pulled a condom wrapper out of my pants pocket

just as i felt confident and motivated about getting in shape i realized that my window was wide open and my neighbors were getting a front row seat to me waving my arms in the air like an idiot
i went shopping for a nice outfit to wear for a job interview
a fake job interview
one that i just made up so my mother would get off my case about finding a job
i dont know which is sadder the fact that i cant get a job or that my mother actually believed me about the interview
at work i spent half an hour trying to convince an elderly customer that no i wasnt a messenger sent by the devil to take her soul to hell
its been 5 years ive been working for a man that wont admit he has tourettes
he sits at his desk twitching his head and hissing like a snake
hes also randomly said things like nipples jessica simpson potato peeler etc
i feel like its become my job to warn new employees
i paid Â£140 for a train ticket
all the seats were full
when i sat in the corridor the guard yelled at me
i paid Â£140 to stand outside a stinking train toilet for 7 hours
i realized i can tell which one of my 6 roommates has taken a dump just based on the smell emanating from the toilet
i got a letter from my mother-in-law stating that demons made her spread rumors about me all over my hometown before my wedding
i logged on to facebook and had 64 notifications

a coworker introduced herself to me and told me she hopes i enjoy my new job
weve worked in the same building for two years

my first response was dont youll regret it later in life
one of my really close friends changed from being free to quite busy in the space of one conversation because i suggested that we hang out

buyt i did
i maybe just had sex outside in broad daylight
at a state park
please be proud
police were closing down the bar due to gunfight and i was crying because they wouldnt let me finish putting temporary shamrock tats on my boobs
pretty sure i tied my shoes laces together to keep myself from driving drunk
fell like six times
keep forgetting
there are drunk kids outside our building hugging that cop thats always on his bike as hes citing them for public drunkenness
its not even 11 am
speaking of graduation plans im blacked out eating sausage

im going to sleep in my car
and i know
this place is insane
blood on the stairs 5 dollar slices of pizza
a girl on our floor had a stroke

starting drinking whiskey at eight
already had ten girls looking up my kilt to make sure im wearing it right
i had to take off my light up shamrock necklaces my professor was getting suspicious
i dont think my arm is broken i can still text

patricks day
i just wanted you to know in case i die
im applying temporary tattoos with green beer this is the life
i cant see straight with both eyes and ive only been at the bar for an hour
someone else typed this for me
she was puking red wine out the car window telling me about how shes joining weight watchers tomorrow not okay
he started crying and showing me pictures of his ex
she was really pretty
its an honor to have shared a penis with her
aside from the fact that theres a penis in my mouth thats a pretty good picture of me
just so everyones clear it was already on fire when i got there
blacked out at the beach and unblacked out at a piano bar singing tiny dancer
i had a great penis washing session in the sink before i left
washed off all the bar and green beer
hes only going to be home for two days his dick is going to be in me for the whole 48 hours he doesnt have a choice
he was going down on me and raised up for a minute slipped and punched me in the face
my lady boner left immediately
i told myself this year would be different i wouldnt get pee in a fish tank drunk
got to the girls house
fish tank in her room
2 years in a row
had to keep the tradition going
im pretty sure it all started going downhill last night when they suggested i see how much sambuca i could fit in my mouth
i was the last girl at the bar last night
it was like a battle royale between 10 guys
i ended up staying at a police station for being a witness in a public masturbation case
now do you believe me that ive never had a good st
patricks day
i dont even know why im sitting in this office eating a poptart
what are the signs of a concussion please dont freak out
i think off duty cops drove me home
i may have been hitchhiking
turns out my drunken logic and wordsmithing isnt quite the same as the sober version
im pretty sure i made fun of the managers mom at one point
he added me on facebook
im pretty sure he got my name from the inside of the bra i had lost in the frat house
i went up to get a drink from the hotel room
and ended up getting arrested in the lobby
spring break has not been forgiving this year

just crossed the line from casual pregrame to public intoxication
shotgunning in a bus shelter
there was an amgbulance
iw ish i was in it
my glasses are somewhere in your living room
also my underwear might be in your bathroom or on or around your porch

his dick makes me think maybe a monogamous relationship forever is possible
my roommate made me go home after i mooed at fat girls at the gas station
i will be blacked out in the shower

20 mins
just woke up with a blunt in each nostril and a lighter duct taped to my chest
good lookin out
he just laughed at his drink laid on the floor and crawled to the bathroom
dont ever tell me im a bad friend
i woke up at 7 this morning to drive your mistake home because you wouldnt get up
he went to have surgery in the morning and apparently they found lip gloss on his dick
i am safe
everything is fog
mission accomplished
there was a reason that throat warrior 2011 was written on my martini glass
he said my title was undisputed
someone shattered a urinal
we hotboxed my bathroom

he googled the address of the bar then sent me a text saying 6
3 miles
too far
:( apparently i am only worth a 5 mile radius
im pretty sure it started going awry when i asked their mom how much would it cost me to sleep with your daughters

i am so ready to graduate
just saw a crackhead get taken down by pd in the canal
its offically spring

driving around panama at 7 am looking for an open liquor store
yeah hes still asleep
i washed the blender out
he tried to make a ham-shake
lets wait until after break to have that talk
i kind of want to see where this goes
i tipped the hot bartender my entire wallet
ive had more sex in the two weeks since we broke up than i ever had in any two weeks we were together
do you actually have a paper bowl full of broken glass and ecstasy or was that just a dream
yeah i probably scared him away when i drunkenly told him wed have beautiful children

patricks day party
i touch his dick
i get him on the high holidays
should i feel bad that my boyfriend pays for my birth control and his friends get to reap the benefits
dizzyuy bat
453 lkos
hoit sx now im single
you probably have like 11 voicemails from us one is us singing my heart will go on while were fucking
im blasting fat bottom girls as loud as humanely possible in attempts that old ladies doing water aerobics will take the hint and get the fuck out of the pool
i just need to actually convince myself that drunkenly having sex wont help me forget the last time i drunkenly had sex it only makes the situation worse
i figured if im going to wear a gold cape its pretty safe to assume ill be blacking out as well
hey i found one of your nipple clamps under my couch i miss you
i think it was the shoes and limping
not the sex
i could b wrong
i feel like i just walked the hall of shame thru the marriott
everyone stared
lesson learned
never get fingered on an airplane
im not embarrassed about the lap dance
im embarrassed for the singing during
he woke up got my bottle of water and poured it on me and then went back to sleep
not really how i want to wake up at 2 a
hah i lost the lenses in my glasses didnt event notice til this morning
how was the meeting
he called the drink the annexation of puerto rico
he wouldnt tell us whats in it but said that we should all fear for our lives
lets do this
where is my rescue team
i keep hiding shit
and im trying to give out shots of olive oil
she just punched a dude and called him a peasant for not drinking fast enough in flip cup
i just had to give myself a pep talk to stop lying on my floor
literally too hung over to function
maid of honor is brides sister and single
likes lemondrops
youre welcome
some bitch filled my sink with salsa
reaaaally cool
my cat ate my birth control
woke up laying in the kitchen floor with a cup in one hand and the beer tap in the other
guess i just needed that one last beer
she just referred to her vagina as this bitch
i could write a book on how to barely get by in community college
i just took an online quiz on my phone at the bar 6 minutes before it was due
wow that was a lesbian tornado
of course he wants me there for his birthday
if a girl offers you a blowjob for every year of your life youre gonna want her to be there
dude im importing a boy from oklahoma for my divorce party
its like doctors without borders but with dicks
my glasses smell like tequila
i just put them on and almost threw up
if you fool around take the white sweatshirt off of her first
its mine and i dont like your cum nearly as much as she does
theres just something about sucking a flaccid dick that makes me feel so calm
like a baby cow
well as a member of the greater american southwest gay community i just have to mark this as a total loss and you will be missed
he yelled juice on the loose yes i am sure i need plan b
she was like the rudy of blow jobs
so much effort into it
we tried to make a sex tape but we were hammered and she forgot to take the cap off the camera
somebody starts snoring 10 minutes in
no way
if i brushed past your penis it was completely coincidental
he still lectured me about forgetting shit
than he said hes gonna paint me green so i can stand in a corner and be a plant
i just had to download an app to edit pictures on my new phone
the things i do for sexting
boxed wine mondays was one of our finer ideas
all she said to me last night is that when her eyes roll back to release my choke hold
the other night after we fucked we talked about lowes vision insurance
never fuck a coworker
professor came back from spring break missing a tooth
why is everyone in the bowling alley looking at me like im a prostitute just because i have bunny ears on
we took shots then she made me eat a dill pickle with cream cheese wrapped in a piece of turkey
i woke him up and he was mumbling something about it being moist or he peed himself but it was okay
he tried to breastfeed my turtle
just blew a perc off the traytable on my flight spring break has begun
you do realize that you tried to eat the neighbors cat because the dominos guy was 5 minutes late
you would have succeeded if we didnt stop you
i think their strategy was based on people bein at a beach seein a rainbow and havin an orgasm at the same time
my nipple ring is gone but someone was nice enough to replace it with a paperclip
in the middle of getting a blow job she looked up at me and said this isnt the first time ive done this today
she gave him a lap dance on the glass table
you can guess how that ended
sorry i fell asleep again
im in the shower now
door is unlocked
condoms are in my desk
i want your game face on for when i get out
were almost there
shes pounding on the car window telling the nurse whos on a smoke break to fuck off
anything for my little brother
thanks for celebrating my birthday so severely 2 years ago
i just found your hospital discharge papers in my closet
im gonna start fucking more girls with asthma
help feed my ego
sometimes you gotta take the crosseyed stripper
fuck it
i think my penis ruined a perfectly good friendship
next year we will be 30 and no more shots during the week
we invented diesel bombs
theyre supposed to be a bomb but they come in a 20+ oz
glass and have a blackout record of 6 wins and 0 losses
undoubtedly going to be the next muhammed ali of the drinking world
dude if she brings up the lube you know nothing
it is official
its the year of doin married chicks
similar to the year of virgins but without all the baggage
getting a black eye the first day of spring break really sets the tone for the rest of the week
missing: one left eyebrow
reward if returned
then he complimented me on how excellent i was at breathing through my nose
oh i forgot to tell u
i hit someone with my car in the riteaid parking lot
more like a nudge
just called the bar: hi this is the girl who you kicked out for excessive bleeding do you happen to have my coat
i found her in the bathroom licking her screwdriver off the floor
she said there was no way she was wasting a $6 drink
that penis youre staring at is the penis of heartbreak
stay away
it will break your heart and keep you away from other penises
the penis
i just headbutted my cat because he was trying to eat my bacon
if he thought that flying across an ocean to visit me in london constituted sex he thought wrong
this dude was wearing a plan b- one step backpack
i wonder how many more i have to buy until i get mine
i dont think he wanted to hear that my most serious relationship was my 1 1/2 year fuck buddy
i think he figured out thats where hes heading
she found 60 bucks at the strip club
its probabably been in a vagina but really most money probably has
you mean the girl who was passed out face down on the bathroom floor until 10 am youre right she was cute
im considering failing out of my last semester of college just so i can keep fucking him
woke up next to my bed in a pile of skittles sleeping on a pair of sweatpants
i cant believe the girl didnt stick around
yes she gives me platonic blowjobs as part of our friendship
he called his prostate his boner button
so how does it feel getting bood by the entire 5 guys restaurant
i had no where to run
the dumpster sounded like a good idea at the time
i couldnt sleep so i drunk ellipticaled for an hour
i just had to tell her that no she really doesnt need to sneak pizza from mcmurrays out in a plastic bag for me later
i had to write an apology letter to security guards in the hotel so i didnt get kicked out
she said she wanted to have closure sex
i just feel like im gonna be remembered as that one ra guy that used to sell weed
although last time you were unsure about someone they flipped a golf cart on me
i was just compiling a top 5 blowjobs list and thats in there for sure
i think im finally maturing
im happy he found someone
good for him
i sincerely hope she doesnt choke on his tiny penis
well let me tell you it was the most vivid sex dream ive ever had
more so than the paris hilton one i had in 05
and about as weird
im love that were talking about a possible 3rd 3some and that youre going to be a dad
was that not clear on friday when i nearly deapthroated two ice cubes
just had to return the shit i stole from the dining hall with everyone watching
apparently there are consequences for being drunk coked up and belligerent
so im coping with getting the im not over my ex bomb dropped on me by getting drunk and yelling at people while wearing a purple princess hat
hahahaha you would not believe what i just pulled out of my vagina
actually you probably wouldnt be surprised
just realized the guy is in my class
unless theres another guy that had half his ear bit off at a st
pattys party
when else am i ever going to have a chance to do lines with t-pain
im pretty sure there was a language barrier but he knew what harder meant
look you found him on craigslist
you should be happy that he at least has a normal looking dick
fyi the landlord called said we need to clean the puke off the side of the house
was someone on the roof lastnight
apparently i have a urinal in my bedroom
you had it for us with someone else
we didnt even have break up sex
after throwing up the toothpaste tasted so good
thank you for not letting me eat it
he ran five blocks just to watch me and my best friend make out
i think hes a keeper
just a heads up the coffee pot is filled with jager
i just had to hear from a third party that he came inside of me
i am fine
katie thinkr i broke things pole dancing
i am coherant
after the second day the hotel realized i wasnt responsible enough to have a comforter so they took it for the rest of the trip
despite fighting the urge to vomit throughout the whole thing i think that interview went really well
she made me go down the fire escape when her mom came for breakfast
remember the girl passed out in front of my fireplace
just bought all my wine for the weekend with a check at 11am
im almost judging myself
chasing 100 proof soco w water from the tap at 4 pm its gonna one of those kinda thursdays
i hope the walls stop moving before my manager notices that im still drunk
first i must say that i am disappointed to learn that you knowingly have trashy friends with whom youve not hooked me up
i pretended i was deaf and got a girl to come home with me
there are 5 pictures on my phone from last night 4 are too blurry to recognize and the 5th is you dangling a twizzler over your mouth naked
the best sex is duke just lost sex
i have no recollection of sleep choking you
i tried to fuck this guy who im pretty sure has an erectile dysfunction
just for future reference: milk is not a good mixer no matter how drunk you are
he threw me out a window and then threw raw ground beef at us
normally youd hate someone for that but that guys great
i just test ran being their maid
im getting 50 bucks a month and theyre buying the costume
they would be such cute babies and they would grow up to have huge dicks
and that would make me proud as a mother
taking shot for every red box on your worst bracket
i have 30
i might die tonight
apparently i grabbed her ponytail and cut it with an exacto knife
meanwhile i am sitting on the couch with a 32 ounce rum and coke trying to decide if im too drunk to go get french fries
when the cops knocked on the door he just knocked back and announced house keeping
i can feel the alcohol in my calves
sorry i pulled the thermostat off the wall
a burger king employee called me from your phone while you were on their bathroom floorl
hope ur not in jail
4 realz
i know and i thought i was only capable of loving dick and drugs im so happy
looking for the remote in the couch
finding adderall beads
considering utilizing
hahaha i asked him about her bjs and he said i would not wish that on anyone
if you try to operate on me with a bic pen and vodka im never talking to you again
i was the definition of a shit show
i woke up outside my door when my alarm went off
wasnt a date
in exchange for artichoke dip i received a bj
and sex
it was a transaction
did i call you last night crying about tacos and the royal wedding again
and now there are teeth marks on my dick
you know it takes a lot for me to use utensils conservatively
i got used
this is the happiest day of my life
i was just a huge cock and that is all she needed
you just stood there spinning and got mad if anyone tried to stop you
do not get into a discussion with my roommate when im sitting there naked ever again
i just found a bag of teeth
whats the name of that soccar player i bit again
the fact that its 530pm and im saying to myself i should sober up since im at a family establishment should say enough
we all know tonight is going to end like every other night with you
drunk pantless and confused
dont try to switch things up
i wish i had a puke in your car emoticon
let me start this apology by saying you were the finest piece of ass i ever had
first coke bust down the road
spring is finally here
just had an awkward elevator run in with that guy you puked on
you can come over sure
but ill be watching college hockey during the blow job
i really cant get over how proud i am of all us getting laid at the same time in the same apartment
new rule during sex: if it causes you to take your rings off dont do it
congratulations you fucked a nickle into me
i just unblacked out cuddled in a pita pit booth with ten dollars rubberbanded to my hand
i need input can i pre-game my cat scan
i dont really see how asking you not to cum on my face or hair makes me high maintenance
you should get a handy in the street again just to prove youve still got it
new rule : you arent allowed anything
did i happen to mention where i left my keys when i drunk dialed you last night
why does it always end up with me crying in my car
she gave me one of those friendship bracelets and said as long as i wore it it was like an all-access pass to her vagina
she didnt even ask about the dinosaur pinata in my trunk
like at this point i think these are the things she expects from me
i was just about to send a concerned text until i opened my door and saw a shopping cart
im glad you made it home in one piece and with toys
i feel like a fucked a broomstick last night
you get a gold star
i sat alone in my bed and ate pizza and garlic fingers
the icing on the cake was hearing your moans from down the hall
at one point he was caressing me in the kitchen asking me my name over and over again and then asking what my favorite continent was
also theres a dick sized hole in my tights
should i be worried
in an unknown location
with a giant marshmallow stuck to my back
hello breakfast
i may have broken a few toes and my face hurts
i do know that i pissed the bed so at least ive got some closure there
when you tell me you got me a birthday present i have to assume it will show up in a drug test
i got a phone call from security asking me to do my laundry wearing more than a blanket next time
i think i had to give the cab driver my id to get home last night because i couldnt talk
big cup lots of nomnomd tuospy
she gave me head because i gave her my pack of cigarettes
and you said quitting would be hard
no one intentionally makes bad decisions just errors in judgement
you have your boyfriend i have a restraining order from universal studios
its all relative
so i totally just remembered that you tried to smoke a hornet out of its nest
im going to look like a jackass in the mexican newspaper tomorrow
there was a trail of blood coming out of one of the bathroom stalls
thought of you
i fell asleep with all the lights and heat on in the apartment with windows open earth hour is lost on people like me
you gave the cab driver your pants as collateral while you ran in the house for money
my dildo fell into the bathtub
it sounded like a chainsaw
there are bruises on the top of my foot
the pole won
this isnt fair
i just want to have sex with you until i lose consciousness wake up and start over
is that so much to ask
i have now slept with people from more countries than ive actually visited
can we make this a game somehow like foreign fuck buddy bingo
he got tattooed peirced and were pretty sure he got rufeed by that fat chick
he was like a walking spring break stereotype
i had to throw a towel over the bottles cuz it hurts to look at them
just got tipped $5 for distracting some dudes gf while he got another girls number
bro-code at its finest
hey you forgot your wet suit in my room you can come grab it whenever
yeah we figured out that passing a joint between cars was a pretty bad idea
i dont understand but i fell asleep naked holding a tub of cool whip and a boiled egg
and there are taco shells on the ceiling fan
on a side note i think i burnt my eyebrow when we teter-totered into the fire
yeah he gave the rest of the brownies to the bouncer that took his fake
shes either too fat to type hammered or has terrible spelling
please please please tell me that is not a pringles container full of pee that your little brother just got a hold of
my dick is covered in produce stickers
i suspect you
why oh why did i suck thise tits
nothing but trouble fuuuuuu
i had to take the fire extinguisher from him
he was just sitting on the floor petting it
be careful theres warming lubricant on the floor
i will clean and explain later
i put labels all over the house on things i think are mine
a cactus the dog and a bottle of wine
i was driving around baked windows down jamming to third eye blind and eating grapes for 35 minutes before i remembered why i left my house
pre-crushing the pills for tomorrow morning
this way i can sleep in an extra 10 minutes
the girl behind me in psych just tapped me on my shoulder to tell me there was a condom wrapper in my hood
my overnight senior got drunk and hooked up with kaylee on sunday
i checked facebook and he already put down his deposit for next year
this school should pay me a commission
i think i dropped my cock ring in your back yard
maybe its all the xanax she takes but she literally has no shame
either i need to stop bringing you back to my apt or i need to stop buying ikea furniture
i cant believe i had to convince you to not drink butter
her face is stuck to the frozen jager bottle
i think shes ok with it
thank you as well
my penis is starting a slow-clap right now
i have to keep checking shes breathing
this is why we dont drink on sundays
he panicked you ducked and i was coming off a 3 day coke binge
it was no ones shining moment
you walked in on me taking a shit and told me to hit the bong
he just sent me a winky face in the middle of setting up a drug deal
you dont do that
i shouldnt have to thank you for taking off your captain hat off before we had sex
aaaaand that would be the most of my hand ive ever fit into a vagina before
i left the icescrapper in his bathroom
i dont remember taking it there but i remember brushing his hair with it
i am literally hand feeding my crying ex boyfriend taco bell
what has my life become
the guy in the next stall screamed courtesy flush and then puked
bless you vegas
his blow is so strong i threw up
buy it
im in nursing school i know what im talking about
i had to step in when you tried to make it rain baking powder on my sister
i have to overdose on valtrex i had a rough weekend
do you remember calling me and dedicating a shot to me
no that means he mustve used the nipple clamps
you kept thanking chef boyardee for having pull tab cans
i smell like captain morgan and tears
i woke up next to a ladle and a packet of chocolate biscuits that my face had melted into one giant biscuit
dude im passing out in the fifth floor janitors closet
let me know when the rooms opened back up
do you recall us playing flip cup on your head
when you wake up in your dorm right outside your room with the key in the door then you will understand my pain
i feel like a squirrel prepping for the winter on dollar beer nights
your oragel will numb anything theory was the worst thing i ever believed in
divorce is final
doing tequila shots at 1 in the afternoon
he had a curved dick
must be a european thing
i should have to wear a sign around the rest of the day so everyone knows the shame i feel
if your wondering where your blanket is i put it on the 2 guys you brought home last night
their still sleeping outside on the trampoline
you screamed at all of us and then showed us your sack
youre like the boyfriend of my dreams
theres a picture of you hanging up on the wall in mcdonalds im impressed
no not at all
pulling a condom out of your vag at 2pm is nothing like finding $10 in your winter coat
stop trying to make me feel better
if you ever get the opportunity make fun of how small his dick is for me
the waitress bought us a round
she said if anyone could do 52 margarita mondays in a row it was us
hes got a southern drawl and a lisp
im getting mindfucked right now
and i highly doubt it could be awkward
you do remember our introduction was a direct result of you mentioning your affinity for my genitals right
at this point i really just need a sign in sheet for my vagina
yea im pretty sure it has something do with my love of forearms
i was gonna fuck her but then she started eatin sushi from her purse
i really need to raise my standards
was i shouting at a fire engine last friday
we are not buying weed off a guy from the internet
there is a 15 subwoofer mounted inside our fridge
ive never been more proud of myself
check facebook
random dude tagged us in photos from last night dancing at dennys while eating a sampler platter

everything was going well until edgar threatened to handcuff the security guard to himself
i decided what we are doing for your 21st b-day: camelbacks filled with margaritas
i had a guy present me his prison release form this morning as id
on the bright side i still get a $20 referral bonus at the plasma center even though he passed out during donation because he was so high
just ordered an appetizer sampler to distract the fat chicks so we can escape
its like hes trying to get head in every car except his
youre not a real person
youre actually just like a box of wine that can talk
had dinner with my ex husband
the box of wine is gone and im laying on the floor in my wedding dress
where are you
i am sitting on the couch eating a frozen big bucket margarita with a spoon
woke up to the sound of my own moans coming from the tv
evidently it was videotaped
i dont think a sorry ive slept with most of your teammates text will do much
ya shes here
it looks like she just gave up and passed out on the floor
we lost track of him for only 10 min and he gets kicked out for sneaking into the kitchen and trying to operate the deep fryer
thanks for waiting 12 hours to ask if i was in a ditch or not
taking back a box of condoms is possibly the most depressing thing ive ever done
its a guy he gets weed for
im kinda confused as to why there are going to even be tuxedos involved at all
im doing this for my boobs
they miss him
your penis has nothing to do with my throat infection sorry
the a/c is broken so they cut a softball size whole in the freezer door

there are too many people on this bus for it to be even remotely okay that im wearing a puke covered sweater
he just sent me a picture of me icing a cake with a butcher knife topless
ok maybe i dont want to know what happened last night
but somehow i guess i moved the oven
she just looked down there and said i breed horses
this is better than anything ive ever seen
level of my singleness - just ate a whole pizza topless in bed
its like his penis is gods way of saying sorry about his face
i have a music final in an hour so i put all the classical songs we need to know in a shower power hour playlist beer included
my mom said that if she can come this weekend shell buy the weed
i am literally using a balloon as a pillow on a park bench
i know i said i wouldnt but he told me i looked like mila kunis
reasons not to fuck him go
my god
well be gay porn millionaires
it doesnt count as road head if youre parked
considering how often you blow himhigh
he pocket texted me while i was blowing him in the car
what are the odds
he kept his baseball cap on when he went down on me
he kept his baseball cap on when he went down on me
well im currently dressed up as batman raiding frat houses for booze
its like my ice maker knows when i wanna get drunk
i lost count after the 4th body shot but i think im wearing at least 3 different peoples clothes

in case you were unaware playing with rabbits on ecstasy is the greatest thing ever
i feel like im oding on adorable right now
dude this breakup has officially hit rock bottom
sitting around watching womens ncaa basketball instead of going out
so southern
then he wanted a handjob in the car
while my cousin was driving
to krispy kreme
and there was someone else in the backseat
for once the $56 i am about to pay for plan b was actually worth the sex
we found you on the floor drooling you kept saying over and over how you were double jointed
ya well my good-girl image was pretty much blown when he found out im going to jail soon
i mean once you get beat with a dildo you cant look at someone the same
she was shooting whiskey using a turkey baster
i was horrified
he sent a pic i sent one back
then nothing
its like we sext-messaged goodbye and ended the relationship
no she passed out instead
i have the worst luck its like jesus is mad at me for having the same birthday as him
i know she was blacked out but she looked directly at the toilet and said we meet again
can you pinpoint the moment you decided it was acceptable to trade blow jobs for beers or was it a gradual slide
i want to hold her baby but im afraid ill give it a contact buzz
we had to leave the bar because you were trying to show the bartender your boobs for water
i should teach a seminar on how to fall off the wagon
he broke up with her mid blow job and somehow convinced her to finish
i want his life
you also choked him out with your legs on the kitchen floor
before attempting to fly away into the night you asked me to take care of your sister
i agreed
thank god i did vegas bombs with those cops at their christmas party
we should so be in jail
the great thing about skinny blondes is that theyre all interchangeable
im trying to find a facebook picture of him that doesnt make me regret sleeping with him

then i realized i was alone sitting on the bathroom floor brushing my teeth at 2am laughing to myself
i woke up with cheeseburger in my mouth and a deep sense of accomplishment
its 6 am and me and the girl in the next apartment have been taking turns puking and yelling never agaaaain thru the walls
currently flirting with a 57 year old
why do i do this
did i crawl through the hotel lobby all the way to our room
i guess wearing a straight up bikini to class is an early indication that thirsty thursday has started
unintentionally made him cum in his own mouth and he just sat there screaming
i feel like my teeth are sweating
well if were past the bullshitting stage yes if not then no im not that kind of guy
this whole night would have been avoided if the liquor store had air heads
lost another pound
switching from beer to hard liquor did this body good
just got tipped $5 to put a barbie in a waffle cone and drip caramel sauce on it while a group of dudes cheered and one took pics
90% sure they were sober
in all seriousness
vodka almond milk and chocolate syrup make a decent white russian
depending on hangover severity
the fact that i can spell severity is in your favor
drunk walkin through police station
you were doing karaoke
then you screamed shoutout to adam lambert and started making out with the very surprised looking guy next to you
oh and thanks to you
im now stuck in the living room held hostage listening to my roommates how i discovered i was bi story
fuck you
im not entirely sure that not getting kicked out of the bar until it got dark really classifies as doing better
lets watch the sunrise turned into lets have sex on the roof at six thirty in the morning
the doctor asked me what height i fell from to hurt my back
i answered keg height
i really dont think you should have baptized your tattoo in vodka the same night you got it
going home with an argentinian named sulvio
ill let you know how it goes
we woke up under the ping pong table holding hands
remember that time we were in the handicap bathroom snorting molly at the stripclub
that was a defining moment in our friendship
when i sent you a text telling you to splash water on your face you texted me back with iwehre n qyull
she wouldnt play beer pong with me unless i took off the rollerskates
she called for a booty call so i sent mike as my stunt double
i woke up marinating in beer on my beanbag
idk what you mightve done
he walked into my room in the middle of the night whispered something about the patriot act and took my tv
only thing i know is apparently i danced with a bouncer and we got a ride back from a valet who was driving one of the cars he was supposed to be parking
my first sex dream i blew myself
yours definitely wins
i was batman and i saved her
then we had sex on a rooftop
there are now half chewed girl scout cookies plastered to my windshield
do you know anything about this
ill just tell him i slept with them both because we needed to compare notes
you inspire me to be a worse person
apperanlty i was screaming its hard to swim with a broken ankle sir and then tackled the lifeguard
the joys of blackouts
they told me you were taking cheese cube shots and chasing them with barbecue sauce
is this true
he tried to eat me out in the bath
i said it was a bad idea but he said it was good snorkelling practice for vaca
there is nothing like getting stoned and spying on people with binoculars
riding on an electric horse at the grocery store
dunno how that conversation went but i hope you picked up a 12 pack
so im on with some ukrainian stripper for a vodka tasting tomorrow
if i die tell my family im awesome
i just pulled a handful of rice out of my pocket
i ended up with a bullet proof vest and i still dont know his last name
she came over and gave me a handy and then just lingered for a day and a half

water in fridge
mixers for vodka
and reality checks
malibu coconut giveth and malibu coconut taketh away
i just woke up to a text from him apologizing for making me eat a full lemon

i miss our vodka / percocet laundry days
hey couldnt find water bottle to put margs in whole bottle in purse gonna stop and get cups and ice from starbucks and burrito from una mas want a quesadilla
did someone do a keg stand in my bathtub
hahaha i forgot about doing shots out of the bell pepper
me neither
i remember bell pepper tequila but not why or yelling
you thought last year was bad
a guy dressed as a clown showed up with cocaine
i just dropped off shoes at mikes hotel
the chick he hooked up with last night stole his phone and shoes
you realize at the bar last night we blew on imaginary whistles like rose from titanic right
so this hammed chick got arrested and she keeps trying to make out with the cop
i like her style
i remember you telling me to take a shower brush my teeth go get back in bed w her and just do what i was born to do
and as soon as i stopped yacking i did just that
you saved my birthday
why is the word best written on my chest
she had that i just got used look on her face when i kicked her out at 5am
we put a pacifier in your mouth because you kept drunkenly singing country music
yes perhaps we are both wrong
and did you call me bj girl
my ta just came over to give us drugs
now hes drinking grey goose with my roommate and explaining his thesis to her
this is too much
im not 100% but im pretty sure at some point i was rubbing ur bfs beard telling him how magnificient i thought it was
i was trying to be really smart and save 10 dollars for each cab there and back
so i ripped a $20 dollar bill in half
oh my god
im sorry if i peed on you last nite
i am truly disgusting
ask her if said friend is decent looking or a wildabeast
need to know if i need to top these 8 coronas off with a little tequila
just invented taco cereal
everything in my purse is 100% saturated in red wine which made it challenging to cover up my booze breath with franzia soaked gum
you were offering to spell peoples name for a dollar
sorry if i put you in that glad were hanging out but im gonna go fuck your cousin kind of position
just coat-checked 2 backpacks full of 40s
it was the bouncers idea
you were yelling in my ear lets double team her with her right next to us
where did this taco bell managers name tag come from
let me start this apology by saying im sorry that i bit your penis
i wanna pet his head its so fluffy
were gonna open a petting zoo
he tied my whole arm in its cast to the headboard first
he mumbled something about safe sane and consensual
i found a fried uncrustable on the table from last night
call me when you wake up
i wanna start drinking but im giving up hope on my life if i drink alone before 10 am
im having flashbacks of crying and telling you i was made out of egg salad
he just told me hes been drinking vodka at work all day
im starting to believe in soul mates
i just added no after every hockey player in my phone
jenny was looking for something soft to drink since its only noon she chose spiced rum
think she might die today
you fell on your face and the waitress just brought you a fresh drink
so it looks like you may be an uncle real soon
dont ask how i feel about it and dont text me back
i strongly considered not bringing that guy home with me last night simply because id just changed my sheets that morning
on my way
they just started filling water ballons with vodka
just peed on the 7/11 floor and casually left
omg so drunk
how you manage to cockblock me from 500 miles away still baffles me
the fact that both my ribs are severely bruised from shoving flasks in my bra might be a validation of my mothers alcoholic accusation
im almost positive that in mid thrust she told me she was pro choice
we decided to play beer pong where the loser had to beer bong a pitcher of beer
people just started losing on purpose
it was a bad idea
i did shrooms last night
my drug checklist is complete i can finally graduate
this is part your fault too
dont tell me your dishes are unbreakable and not expect me to prove you wrong
whatevss it will be funn
hopefully no one projectile vomits on the wall again
its kinda become a tradition though
the fact that he is from canada is way more embarrassing than the fact that you met him on match
my pizza lunchables wont fit in the fridge because of all your alcohol
one of our addictions has to give
i watched you ride a mechanical penis
nothing is awkward between us anymore
she just tagged pictures of you wrapped in the above the influence banner like a toga
walked in on my boss having phone sex at work
and somehow this didnt bother nor embaress him
at beerfest hammered going to try to not get naked in public but i cant make any promises
the kid that passed out is still in the bathtub filled with ice and the empties
should i tell her she gave me head in the kitchen while i was eating a cupcake or would that hurt her dignity too much
u asked everyone for their hoodies so u could safely hug the cactus
all i remember is repeatedly winking at the fire marshall while he was counting the people in the bar
i should go buy the economy size box of condoms and sprinkle a path like rose petals to my bed
think hed get the hint
she told me she eats fruit when shes hungover because it has more water than water
ya i dont think she expected you to get with her boyfriend
she couldve warned me his penis was curved
i swear about 40% of my drunken life is spent having sex with him
im going to die alone in a sea of empty vodka bottles and cats
hes currently rapping every word to more money more problems at what could be a over 30s gay bar
im not sure yet
more info to come
every facebook tagged picture of yours you are either drinking swimming or drunk in water
there is a guy stoned out of his mind only wearing slippers and a bathrobe in the library
he has the hands of the vagina gods
im in search of the perfect penis it would be unethical for me not to test run them
so i do have strep
my apologies to the british guy from this weekend
you now have one more reason to hate america
i have got to stop getting laid on my lunch breaks
i am so hungry right now
his extensive knowledge of the age of consent laws kinda scares me
he told me i just kept sending him the word sex and dollar signs
sleeping with two different guys who share a driveway is getting increasingly challenging to keep secret
is there any chance i can see you without pouring vodka on your head
she was kind of put off because i kept calling her baby my spirit animal and staring hungrily at her breasts
i basically get to watch her life fall apart via tumblr updates
just when i thought i had forgotten how badthe sex was he comes across campus solely to say hi
your lack of a response has proven youve clearly forgotten how crazy i am
hes tryingto open a beer with a police baton

something strange is happening to me i think i miss hooking up with girls sober
sometimes when i see a shoe on the side of the road i get a little depressed that ive never partied that hard
woke up in a kilt
and its not my kilt
drinking was a success
sometimes he has weird facial hair
basically he has a penis
thats what hes got going for him
numbies before the dentist such a good idea
you peed in my camelbak and said it was a reverse catheter

lesson learned
whipped cream will eat through a condom
sorry about bonging beers with your mom but in all fairness you were late
the swelling on my elbow and tongue means i may have cockblocked myself
her grandmother had a handicap stair lift
i just put her drunk ass on it and let her ride it up
thank god for broken hips
seriously in what other class can the final major discussion be what bar youre going to with your prof
you were hugging the toilet and shouting dont let fatty eat me through the closed door
ask if he wants his tooth back
its in the freezer
in the box of hotpockets
when i tried to put the condom on he started screaming about how he didnt want his groceries bagged
guy next to me is looking up how to press his own ecstasy pills

drinking with a woman who gave an anti-drugs speech at my high school

i was masturbating with the shower head and someone flushed the other toilet
pretty sure i have 3rd degree burns on my clit
weekend has begun hello red wine at 10am on a wednesday
the interviewer had a hook for his right hand i tried to shake his hook what is wrong with me
thanks so much for stopping me from telling him i want to have sex with him while i proceeded to hookup with the air
yea my vagina was pretty pissed at me for not taking advantage of the situation
i should start riding the bus again so i can drink all day
i feel this will be the best possible way to start a friendship
by breaking into his house
its a special occasion
hence the 151
so im sitting outside the gym eating a 20 piece nugget stoned out of my mind convincing myself this is more productive because im so close to the treadmills

whats the protocol when you drive the girls head into the wall during sex and she starts to cry
if you go to the bathroom dont ask why theres diet coke on the toilet
loller copter
blow is fun
its because you were crossfaded
and because drinks were 3 dollars
and because they accepted credit cards
stripperoke is exactly what it sounds
thats why you have fulfilling relationships with nice girls and i have kinky sex with crazies
asking the cop for directions wearing a lion mask may not have been my best moment
did we fight the bathroom girl she just wanted to give us lotion and condoms
there was a handprint of blood on his shoulder
nope im down the street in my car watching the front of her house
its actually less creepy than it sounds
things you owe me: a sober apology $12 the removal of bbq sauce from my doorknob

he was alternating between taking bites of butter and bagel
he said it was easier than finding a knife
theres a stripper banging on the door demanding to see you

pretty sure god shed a tear when i put 15 singles in the collection plate
do you know anything about the easter basket sitting on my doorstep filled with porn and peeps
we were walking and you spelled the word oats to prove you werent drunk
theres nothing like sitting directly behind someone you fucked 5 years ago at church on easter sunday
dont be alarmed at the girl laying on your bathroom floor
just because you put plan b in my easter basket doesnt give you an excuse not to wear a condom
i was walking around outside with a basket of eggs
i feel like little house on the prairie: hungover edition
im celebrating the fact lent is over and i can give blow jobs again
have invented new cocktail
any flavor of crystal light and vodka
i call it i am going to die alone

i think that will suffice
let me just say
im sorry about setting your carpet on fire
i had no idea that the paper towel would burn that quickly
shes just sitting here eating cilantro out of my herb garden and watching some show about ducks on tv and laughing what the fuck did you give her
i have retrograde ejaculation as a side effect from one of my meds

his hunger strike for change lasted 4 days
hi welcome to my coke binge last weekend

they were fucking between cars in the parking lot and everyone was cheering at them
i have bruises on my ass from her spurs

while i was sleeping he changed my screen saver to his dick with a heart frame around it
i just might be falling in love
but barely
had dinner with my parents tonight which was conveniently located near where i left my car phone and self respect

he was like the dessert in the all you can eat man buffet that has become my life
hannah wants to know if she cant borrow your stats notes because she threw up on hers
you passed out in my bathroom last night
i put a towel over your face so i could shit without it being gay
seeing two hook-ups in tagged in the same picture will send chills down anyones spine
when she first told me she hooked up with him my initial response was to shout we have something in common
he gets a blow job; i get my oil changed free of charge
and that way i only see him every 2500 miles
we are probably going to have to use your boobs as currency to get this done
apparently i was pointing at birds and yelling you used to be a dinosaur
were gonna have the chick that teaches kindergarteners to fold origami roll the joints
i gurantee you ill be the only one dressed as a giraffe
all i wanted was to be slutty
now im meeting him for drinks tomorrow because he woke up before i had a chance to sneak out and was too polite to say no
she is trying to turtle bite me and when i pull away she says just let it happen
then she pulled a poptart out of nowhere
i told her that if she blew me i would give her the empty pizza box in the fridge
why did she agree
you left a paper here that says to do list but it looks like you just wrote drink a bunch of cough syrup and watch whos the boss like 60 times
if we break up i want weekend visitations with your penis
one minute we were getting noise complainted by the security guards the next i was shotgunning a beer with them
guess whos bored in chemistry researching how to sneak weed through airport security in her vagina
i cant wait

home safe
screen door is locked so were good
i just called my mom napoleon bronaparte
i need to stop hanging out with you

thats like thanking the pencil for a test you got an a on
i dont think he grasps the fact that i would much rather he finish inside me than on my $400 anthropolgie bedspread
doing blow at 6am to wake myself up for clinicals was a baaaaad idea
he pulled a potato out of his bag in the library

hes going to regret telling me he doesnt care if i shave or not
he apologized for his naked psychotic episode and then we had goodbye sex on his sailboat
i can recognize that vagina from a mile away
i dont know how its possible
but i just bought groceries for a week with the money i made off returning empties
it will be an insanely irresponsible summer
the only things i plan on not doing are dying and getting pregnant
and even those are negotiable
just saw a cop give four blondes gas for their car on their way to vegas
they seriously ran out of gas and called 911 about it
its like a porno plot

these could be the two guys weve been looking for all our lives
for the record chili cheese fritos are not a chaser

he grabbed it and shotgunned it while still holding the case
apparently it isnt appropriate to tell a coworker who is eating celery because its negative calories that a blowjob is too
you looked at me pointed to a car and silently said the elephant parks here
you dont have to believe me
my vagina knows it happened
scarred for life
way too high and witnessed some chick give a dude head on the dance floor
i was laying in her brothers bed in his old room
and i kept getting the chills
i didnt know if it was a draft or the ghosts of bjs past
finally considering to keep my landing strip before i have sex
i feel like it makes me look mature
hungover subway ride filled with german tourists and a mariachi band
too early
too fuckin early
i will now refer to my life as before and after i used astroglide for the first time
why the fuck is the royal wedding at 4am
